		<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll start AGAIN by saying sorry it&#8217;s been so long&#8230;I always seem to have to say that everytime I come on so I obviously need to make more of an effort to write more often!  I&#8217;m now on chemo 12&#8230;soon I can say 12 down, 2 to go.  It feels more like 112 than 12 but hey ho!  It never fails to astound me how quickly the chemo hits me.  I didn&#8217;t get started until after 9 last night (don&#8217;t you just love hospitals!) but so quickly I felt the effects.  It&#8217;s like&#8230;.well I really don&#8217;t know how to describe what it&#8217;s like as it&#8217;s certainly like nothing else I could compare it to.  I guess it is just like having poison put into your veins.  Which is what it is really!  Anyway I&#8217;m on track to be Prof&#8217;s first adult to make it to the full 14!  I&#8217;m determined!  I&#8217;m also scared to get too excited about finishing though as you never know what&#8217;s around the corner&#8230;but that is life and life is for living &amp; I&#8217;m so excited about living my life after being so close to losing it.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a busy time with my dad and nana still not being very well and with me recovering from chemo again, getting the balancing act right with exercising &amp; resting my leg to manage the pain but still made progress.  My poor mum (Goose!) &#8230;looking after and worrying about  her husband, daughter and mum.  &amp; she just keeps going.  I&#8217;ve been told a few times recently that I&#8217;m wonder woman for going through what I&#8217;ve had but I think Goose is Wonder Woman!!  Anwayay the good news is as of a week ago I started driving again!!  WATCH OUT!  I should have warned you all sooner!  &amp; I&#8217;ve now done a whole week of walking without my trusty crutch to help me!  I don&#8217;t really know what changed&#8230;I&#8217;d been thinking about driving for a while but the snow stopped that in it&#8217;s tracks for a long time!  Literally!  No one could get on or off our driveway or down our Close without getting stuck, so the sofa was fine for me!!  So as soon as it was gone and seemed safe (in terms of weather anyway, not sure about my leg!) I just did it!  &amp; loved it!  It was like being 17 again and passing my test and feeling that unbelievable freedom and independence you&#8217;ve dreamed of for so long.  But also very bizarre!  I felt like I was a naughty kid stealing a car or something!  But don&#8217;t worry, it was MY car I was driving!  &amp; as for the walking, the first time I drove I got out my car and got my crutch and it just felt wrong to do that!  So the next day I tried without and I haven&#8217;t looked back.  I think it&#8217;s more psychological than anything &#8211; having the confidence to give it ago and to limp around without the protection of the crutch.  It becomes your tool to walk and balance for so long and I also think it becomes a warning sign for other people and you feel more protected, especially in busy places if people know there&#8217;s something wrong.  Mind you, most people are so absorbed in their own little worlds, they don&#8217;t even notice and don&#8217;t take any precautions to be cautious around you!  Anyway I&#8217;m feeling much MUCH more like myself than I have for a long LONG time.  I think it&#8217;s because I feel like I&#8217;m taking some control over things and taking small steps towards freedom.  I&#8217;m also doing weight watchers, as I&#8217;ve put on so much weight.  This is partly due to me being so immobile since surgery, so without being able to barely walk you can hardly exercise!  But now I&#8217;m finding more gentle exercises that I can do so am trying my best..  It&#8217;s also due to all the medication I&#8217;m on, especially the steroids which are horrible things.  The docs and nurses tell me it&#8217;s to be expected and not to worry about, but all I&#8217;m doing is making more sensible choices and being healthier and cutting down on stuff.   &amp; I feel so much better for doing it&#8230;again I think it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m taking control and looking to the future.  I had too many months with the attitude &#8220;I&#8217;ve got cancer, I can eat what I like!&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also booked 4 holidays!!!  I&#8217;m due to finish chemo in March, all being well.  So on 6th April I&#8217;m off to La Gomera which is the 2nd smallest of the canary islands.  I&#8217;m going with Chris, my mum and dad, my sister &amp; brother in law, my 3 nieces and my brother will come for part of the time.  I CAN&#8217;T WAIT!!  SO EXCITING!  Then in May I&#8217;m going to Portugal with a couple of friends, Gemma &amp; Lou.  Back to Portugal again in June with Chris, Ollie &amp; Laura.  Then BARBADOS in August for 2 weeks with Chris for my friend&#8217;s wedding!  SO EXCITING!  I&#8217;ve also arranged a surprise weekend for Chris and I for Valentine&#8217;s weekend&#8230;I can say no more!  &amp; I&#8217;ve got a few spa trips to fit in too.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also bursting to arrange my &#8216;chemo&#8217;s over&#8217; party but it&#8217;s proving difficult to find a date, with all this holidays and with wanting so many people to be able to make it I&#8217;m a bit baffled at the moment&#8230;but watch this space!</p>
<p>The quote in the title &#8216;I am somebody with cancer and I am somebody without cancer&#8217; is from a book I&#8217;ve started to read which is a collection of stories from cancer survivors.  The first story I opened the book to is by a girl who had Ewing&#8217;s Sarcoma&#8230;my cancer.  &amp; this was a quote from her.  It&#8217;s so so true and that&#8217;s why I love reading things like this because I can relate to them so much.  Earlier on last year, I read Lance Armstrong&#8217;s &#8216;It&#8217;s Not About The Bike&#8217; which was about his fight with cancer and survival against all odds.  It&#8217;s a great read and I recommend it.  Although while I read things like that I&#8217;m like a nodding dog, nod nod nod as I relate to so much of it!  What that quote means to me is that although the cancer&#8217;s &#8216;gone&#8217;&#8230;or they think it has&#8230;you don&#8217;t just stop being someone with cancer just like that.  In fact you never do.  It&#8217;s not something that just goes away.  There&#8217;s the physical implications but also, which is too often overlooked, there&#8217;s the psychological and emotional aspects which are huge and everlasting.  I had yet another echo cardiogram on my heart on Friday to check that the chemo isn&#8217;t damaging my heart&#8230;luckily all is ok there.  Then yesterday I had a CT scan on my chest to check my lungs.  If the cancer comes back it is highly likely to return in my lungs.  Something which petrifies me but &#8216;I can&#8217;t ruin today worrying about tomorrow&#8217;.  This is another quote from another survivor in my book.  Again, very true and something I&#8217;ve had to teach myself with the help and support from my amazing support network.  Chris isn&#8217;t a worrier and is great at putting things like that into perspective.  &amp; my dad has always taught me to live for today and not to worry too much about the future. Obviously you can plan for the future to a certain extent, but you never know what&#8217;s around the corner.  Another quote: &#8216;Life is a journey, not a guided tour&#8217;.  Of course it&#8217;s a worry and sometimes I can&#8217;t help but worry but I have got much better at managing it.  It wasn&#8217;t until I was lying in the CT scanner yesterday that I allowed myself to really think about why I was in there.  &amp; having been diagnosed once when it was soooooooo unlikely, the likelihood now is much higher and my mind can&#8217;t help but go for a wander and run away with itself thinking what if I&#8217;m told it&#8217;s back in my lungs.  But luckily my amazing team here were up seeing me on the ward within about an hour and waiting for the scans to be available on the system.  &amp; they were able to tell me the scan looks fine.  PHEW!!  If it does happen it&#8217;s something we&#8217;ll have to face if and when it happens.  Until then I have to look forward and I&#8217;d rather assume it won&#8217;t happen than assume it will.  Chris says if I cant beat it once I can beat it again.  Hopefully it won&#8217;t ever come to that&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m hoping to make it to a new Sarcoma Support Group here in Oxford next week where it should be a great opportunity to meet other Sarcoma patients.  I&#8217;ve been talking online to a guy just a year older than me who had a similar bone cancer to me.  We&#8217;re hoping to meet up there too.  I&#8217;ve also booked on for a few things at a cancer support centre here.  I&#8217;ve never been able to make it there before as I&#8217;ve never been well enough but I&#8217;m glad I have now as they&#8217;ve been really helpful.  It&#8217;s called the Maggie&#8217;s Centre.  There&#8217;s a few around the country but this is the nearest one for the south.  They&#8217;re currently operating out of a tiny temporary building miles across the many car parks from the cancer centre where I&#8217;m treated.  They&#8217;re currently fundraising to open a new building opposite the main hospital &amp; cancer centre which would be amazing as they&#8217;re such a great support resource but so hard to access at the moment.  SO I&#8217;m hoping to do some fundraising for them too.  There&#8217;s just sooooo many worthy charities, it&#8217;s hard to know who to choose.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to plan to do Race for Life this year.  There&#8217;s not going to be much &#8216;racing&#8217; from me as obviously I&#8217;ll have to walk but I&#8217;m hoping my leg will be strong enough by then.  I&#8217;m determined to do it and to get TEAM SCAMP bigger than I could ever imagine so if you&#8217;re female (sorry boys, girls only!) and are up for joining us and wearing lots of PINK and celebrating with a picnic afterwards and raising as much money for Cancer Research as we can, then email me at <a href="mailto:cara_yapp@yahoo.co.uk">cara_yapp@yahoo.co.uk</a> and I&#8217;ll let you know the details.  The more the merrier!  Don&#8217;t be shy if I haven&#8217;t seen you for years&#8230;if you&#8217;re reading you must be interested so I&#8217;d love to hear from you. &amp; friends/family would be welcome to become Team Scampers too!  If anyone else is reading (as I keep hearing of all sorts of people in all sorts of ways!) but you still don&#8217;t feel you want to comment on here, feel free to email me too!</p>
<p>Right, well I&#8217;m pretty pooped from the chemo.  I hope everyone reading is well &amp; I&#8217;ll try and come back sooner next time!</p>
