		<p>Sorry it&#8217;s been so long since I&#8217;ve written, I&#8217;ve had a strange few weeks.  Before going back into chemo I was keeping myself busy and making the most of feeling ok(ish) but at the same time exhausting myself and then being forced to rest as my body &amp; mind couldn&#8217;t keep up with my ambition!  I&#8217;ve had an emotional few weeks too &amp; have been a bit up and down like a yo yo!  &amp; after another meeting with Prof with lots of heavy conversations and decisions to make, my head was ready to explode!  But the short version is basically that I&#8217;m having to decide now whether to continue with chemotherapy or to stop.  I know it sounds easy &#8211; stop if I can as it&#8217;s so horrible, but if only it was that easy!  We&#8217;re in a position now where they don&#8217;t know which is better for me.  If there&#8217;s a specific reason to stop, e.g. problems with my kidneys or other organs, or more neutropenia then I&#8217;ll have to stop, no choice.  But as it&#8217;s been reduced so much and my body appears to be &#8216;coping&#8217; with it now, then it&#8217;s my choice whether to carry on.  My view has always been that I&#8217;ll go as far as I can with it, to do my best to ensure that the cancer&#8217;s gone and doesn&#8217;t come back.  But again, of course it isn&#8217;t that simple.  There&#8217;s no guarantees either way, of course&#8230;and Prof pointed out that it&#8217;s one of the chemo drugs I&#8217;m still on that could me damaging my fertility.  Unfortunately there&#8217;s no way of telling that though and probably more than likely is that if the damage is going to be done it will have been done already from the intense high dose chemo I was on before surgery.  He says he wishes he had a crystal ball to see the future for me and also that he wishes somehow he could test me out now to check my fertility!  I think the way he said that came out a bit wrong!! HAH!  All these &#8216;ifs&#8217;, &#8216;buts&#8217;, &#8216;maybes&#8217; are enough to drive you mad!  But again, it was pointed out to me that if I&#8217;m not here or if I&#8217;m not well enough to have a family then my fertility would be no use to me anyway.  Not easy but fact.</p>
<p>So anyway I decided to continue and have chemo 10 and now I&#8217;m due a break for Christmas which we all agreed was well needed and well deserved!  So now I&#8217;m just home trying to recover from this one and after several hospital appointments next week I hope I&#8217;ll be able to enjoy Christmas and a short break from being a patient.  I&#8217;m due back in for chemo on 4th January, all being well and if I still decide to go ahead.  The trouble is it&#8217;s not a kind of decision that thinking about will help as the information available isn&#8217;t going to change.  I just have to go with what feels right and to be honest I think the less thinking the better as too much time = too much thinking = worrying!  I just know that if I decide to stop the chemo and then the cancer comes back, I&#8217;ll be asking myself and wondering &#8216;what if..&#8217;, i.e. what if I&#8217;d carried on with chemo maybe it wouldn&#8217;t have returned?  I know you can&#8217;t think like that and we&#8217;ll never know why I got it in the first place, let alone if it came back again, but I just know in my heart and my head that I would think that, so I want to avoid it!</p>
<p>Well, that&#8217;s the short version of my fairly boring update&#8230;I need to get my energy and strength back up so I can tell you some more exciting news soon hopefully!  I&#8217;ll post some pics soon &#8211; our Christmas tree is up and number 2 is going up right now!</p>
<p>Promise to blog more soon so don&#8217;t blog off just yet! xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</p>
