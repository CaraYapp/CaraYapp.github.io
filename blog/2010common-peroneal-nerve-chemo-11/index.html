		<p>Well here I am, back in my usual room 20 in the Churchill hospital in Oxford with chemo running through my veins and paying an extortionate amount for the internet!  So I&#8217;m making the most of it by updating you&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll starting my saying Happy New Year to all you all though and wishing you a HEALTHY 2010&#8230;I won&#8217;t say happy as health should bring you happiness and I won&#8217;t say wealthy as wealth can&#8217;t buy you health.  So just look after yourselves and enjoy each day for what it is and make the most of what and who you&#8217;ve got.  I know you never think things will happen to you or those close to you but you really don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s around the corner.  You can&#8217;t live in fear of that but you can live for now and enjoy it with those you love&#8230;</p>
<p>Well the dreaded 4th January started when I went to see my surgeon yesterday morning.  It was already planned but good timing as for just over a week now I&#8217;ve been have agonising shooting pains down my leg, below my knee and down to my ankle.  It&#8217;s made it really hard to walk and I&#8217;d gone from no crutches round the house back to using 2 of them mostly just to be able to get around.  Disheartening and also scary as I got in a bit of a state, was freaking out a bit about what it might be&#8230;my mind was running away with itself with thoughts and fears of what if the cancer&#8217;s come back, how will I tell everyone, what will happen, what if I have to lose my leg.  Anyway I went to Oxford last Wednesday for an appointment with Prof so I told him.  He checked my leg over and was concerned it could be an infection in my leg in which case it&#8217;d need treating with antiobiotics quickly.  He said he was probably being over cautious but would rather tule that out first and also get scans done to check the prosthesis is all ok.  So he sent me over to the Nuffield where I had my surgery for an ultrasound and some xrays.  The doctor seemed a bit vague, and having never met him before I was a bit unsure and found it hard to trust him totally.  That surprised me as I&#8217;ve always been very trusting of people but it&#8217;s a bit different when your life, or at least your leg, could be at stake!  Anyway he said he saw no obvious signs of anything but would send a report to Prof.  So I left feeling not very reassured and still worry and concerned.  It just brought it all back to me what it was like before my cancer was diagnosed, when I initially had a sore knee.  Everyone was telling me I&#8217;d probably just pulled something whilst running or during aerobics.  But the trouble walking and the sleepless nights due to the pain had come back and no matter how many times Chris said he&#8217;s sure there&#8217;s nothing to worry about and I&#8217;ve probably just strained it by putting extra pressure on other parts of my leg due to my problematic (bionic!) knee, I still had this horrible niggling feeling.  After all I&#8217;d been there once already, I didn&#8217;t really feel like starting that hideous journey all over again before this one is even over. </p>
<p>Anyway so Prof had not received a report and was just glad I was seeing my surgeon, Max Gibbons, as he&#8217;s the expert in this area and he&#8217;s the best person to check it over.  I agreed and was so glad the appointment was already set for Monday.  I just had to get through New Year&#8217;s Eve and try to enjoy that and the remaining few days before life as a cancer patient started again. </p>
<p>New Year&#8217;s Eve was quite emotional for me.  We&#8217;ve been saying for so long how we wanted to see the back of 2009 and 2010 had to be better but as it drew closer, it was just dawning on me that a change of the year won&#8217;t change anything.  The situation is what it is and it&#8217;s not changing for a while.  Saying that thought I can start to see and think about the light at the end of the tunnel and let&#8217;s hope overall 2010 is a better year than 2009 for all of us.  I think it was with my dad and nana being ill too, I just had so much worry inside me but at the same time I was desperately trying to stay strong for me but also for everyone else&#8230; </p>
<p>So New Year&#8217;s Eve turned out to be a very grown up and sophisticated evening&#8230;?!  Well maybe it started out that way!  We did a dinner party for 10 of us in the end, all friends, all couples.  It was all a bit up in the air until the last minute as people had other things going on so the number we were expecting went up and down like a yo yo.  I wasn&#8217;t feeling too goo emotionally or physically and needed to rest my leg, so Chris was the hero and did all the shopping and most of the cooking.  I did help though!  I tried to pick myself up and get into the spirit of things but I just didn&#8217;t feel like celebrating the end of such an awful year, or starting a new year in such a rubbish way.  My leg was agony too and I was trying to put on a brave face, not too succesfully I don&#8217;t think!  Anyway my &#8216;happy act&#8217; didn&#8217;t last too long, patehtic really and the tears came and went early on in the evening.  &amp; my spirits were lifted by my lovely Chris, my lovely friends and a Baileys coffee followed by lots of champagne!  Mostly pink of course!  It didn&#8217;t stay such a grown up, sophisticated evening as we ended up playing suck and blow with a card that came out of a cracker!  It&#8217;s NOT as bad as it sounds.  Has anyone seen the film Clueless then you&#8217;ll know?!</p>
<p>We had a lazy New Year&#8217;s Day to recover along with Ollie and Laura who were a HUGE help tidying up and cleaning the mess from the night before.  THANK YOU GUYS!  Then we played Mario 4 player on the Wii, soooooooooooo good and wasted the day and our hangovers away!</p>
<p>The weekend was a lazy one too, resting my leg as much as possible but I got to see J again &#8211; 3 times in 2 weeks!  Lovely as she now lives in Colchester but we used to live together in Southampton.  &amp; I spent the afternoon with Anna which perked me up as usual.  In the evening we went to our neighbour&#8217;s house who invited everyone from our Close over for drinks.  We were a bit nervous about going as we&#8217;re &#8216;the new kids on the close!&#8217; and I was also nervous about having to explain to everyone about my illness.  It was a lovely evening though and we got to meet most of our new neighbours and they were all lovely.  The couple who&#8217;s house we went to have just refurbished their house, including knocking down lots of walls and making it more open plan&#8230;it&#8217;s gorgeous&#8230;guess what the topic of conversation with Chris was walking home&#8230;&amp;getting ready for bed&#8230;.&amp; in bed&#8230;&amp; the next morning!!  Most sentences started with &#8220;We could&#8230;.&#8221;  I think a can of worms has been opened!</p>
<p>Sunday I was as lazy as possible but we did have to take our Christmas trees down (well done Chris!) <img src="../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":-(" class="wp-smiley" />  Very sad, the house feels empty!  But then my brother came down from London to see me and my sister, brother in law and the 3 girls came over and so did my mum.  So a bit of a full house but only for a little while and it was great to see everyone before the dreading 4th Jan &amp; chemo number 11 arrived.</p>
<p>So back to yesterday and my visit to the surgeon.  He was amazing.  &amp; having already got huge trust in him considering he&#8217;s one of the people I owe my life to as he managed to remove the cancer and save my leg&#8230;.I decribed the pain to him and he went straight to a certain point on my leg and said &#8220;I&#8217;m going to push here and I think it&#8217;s going to hurt!&#8221;  and he did&#8230;and it did!  It was the same pain I&#8217;ve been having.  He continued &#8220;It&#8217;s the commone peroneal nerve&#8221; &#8230;.I must&#8217;ve asked him 4 times during the course of the appointment to repeat the name of it and there were 4 of us in there but 5 minutes later we sat down with a coffee and none of us knew the name!  We came up with all sorts&#8230;commoperitional, compotional, well I won&#8217;t go on, they were all totally wrong and ridiculous!  Anyway it turns out it&#8217;s a nerve that runs down your leg all the way down to the ankle/foot which explains why the pains are going right down there.  He said it&#8217;s common to have this problem after major surgery like I&#8217;ve had and that hopefully it&#8217;ll go away by itself.  This could be soon or could take a long time.  If it persists for a long time they may have to do an operation to fix the problem.  As there&#8217;s some fluid and swelling I&#8217;m supposed to be elevating my leg too.  I practically folded myself in half on the hospital bed last night!</p>
<p>Anyway I&#8217;m just glad I know what it is.  There&#8217;s nothing worse than not knowing.  &amp; I was glad to hear it&#8217;s not an infection, it&#8217;s not cancer, it&#8217;s not something wrong with my new prosthesis, but also glad not to be fobbed off with &#8216;you&#8217;ve strained it, or pulled something&#8217;.  Granted I didn&#8217;t understand all of what he was saying but at least he understands and knows what he&#8217;s doing!  &amp; google has helped me out a bit since!  Although that can be dangerous and scary so no more of that for me!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m back on the chemo now and eventually started yesterday evening.  They had some trouble with my Picc line and then had trouble trying to get needles in for canulas elsewhere.  My veins are hiding more than ever&#8230;some things never change!  Eventually they got the Picc line working and I&#8217;m back with my trusty friend, my drip!  Attached 24/7, seems like I&#8217;ve never been away! </p>
<p>I&#8217;m exhausted today from the chemo and I didn&#8217;t get much sleep being back in here and with my chemo pump beeping every 2 minutes!  I&#8217;m surprised I&#8217;ve managed to write this much, I bet you wish I hadn&#8217;t!  I&#8217;m now in touch with a guy about my age who had the same thing as me and was treated in the same place.  He&#8217;s finished his chemo but it&#8217;s good to talk to someone (on facebook!) who&#8217;s been through such a similar experience.  I think it really helps me, especially as he&#8217;s come out the other side and is getting on with his life&#8230;.</p>
<p>Right enough babbling from me.  I hope 2010 is good for you all so far and going back to work hasn&#8217;t been too gruelling.  I know it seems horrible to go back to work but just remember I (and lots of others) would be doing it if we could!  Remind me of that when I&#8217;ve gone back to work and I&#8217;m moaning!!</p>
<p>Take care xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</p>

					<p>Hey Scamp,</p>
<p>Another great blog that made me giggle!  I&#8217;d forgotten about the suck and blow game momentarily, I think I enjoyed it way too much!!  Do you think instead of having Wii nights we&#8217;ll have suck and blow nights, hehe!!! Maybe not!</p>
<p>Enjoyed spending most of New Years Day with you guys even if we were really hungover!  I couldn&#8217;t believe how late it was, it was getting dark when we left and I was still wearing my PJ&#8217;s and slippers!  It was good fun and thanks very much again for having us.  I love &#8216;bedroom 2&#8242;, I felt so at home there, it was weird!</p>
<p>Glad it went ok at the neighbours, I kept meaning to ask you how it went. I&#8217;ll help you bash down walls if you like, fun!</p>
<p>Anyways, best be off.</p>
<p>Hope you don&#8217;t get too bored.</p>
