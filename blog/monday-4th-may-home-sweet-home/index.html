		<p>I can&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s now Monday I&#8217;m typing this and the last time was Friday&#8230;it all feels very surreal&#8230;like I&#8217;ve lost the weekend, like I was drugged.  Well I guess I did and I was! </p>
<p>Well the sickness started that&#8217;s for sure!   I was sick on Saturday before I moved wards&#8230;nice!  Then I was moved in my bed, think that gave me travel sickness &#8211; they could&#8217;ve warned me so I could put my ebay 99p travel sickness bands on! (they work a treat by the way, if you get travel sickness, get some!!)  Anyway, the nurses came and piled all my stuff into bags and onto trolleys and some onto my bed with me!  I couldn&#8217;t really move to help them as I was pretty dizzy and sicky and still attached to the friggin drip, pretty weird just lying there helplessly while they packed all my stuff up, I felt really bad!  But oh well!</p>
<p>Anna came to visit just after I&#8217;d moved&#8230;in fact she&#8217;s a lucky girl &#8211; she arrived as I was being sick in the toilet!!  I like to give all my visitors (or viewers!!  Sorry Robin!) a nice friendly welcome!!  It was lovely to see Anna as always but I just had to take it easy in bed as wasn&#8217;t feeling good.  Chris came too and my brother Robin and my parents, but it seems so long ago now I can&#8217;t even really remember the order&#8230;sorry guys!  Anyway there were all there which was the main thing.  I started to perk up throughout the afternoon.  I couldn&#8217;t really eat for ages, nothing tasted right and I felt sick&#8230;I had a concoction of drugs to try to prevent the sickness and extra injections too.  I&#8217;ve literally been like a pink cushion.  Since last Tuesday, less than a week, I&#8217;ve had 2 bone marrow biopsies taken, one from the top of each bum cheek!!  An injection in my belly, at least 3 or 4 injections in my arms, plus I think 4 different canulas in my hands/wrists to pump the drugs into my veins!  By the weekend I just had the &#8216;leave me alone&#8217; feeling&#8230;not to Chris or my friends or family (well, I hope, I may have said that, apparently the steroids I&#8217;m on will send my mind a bit ga ga &#8211; more than it already was!)&#8230;but to all the nurses and doctors who keep giving me tablets and injections and changing my drip, taking my blood pressure, temperature, weight, urine&#8230;blah blah blah!  I just wanted to lie in a dark room with no-one talking or touching me and to be left alone until this is all over.  I still feel like that a bit&#8230;of course I wish I could fall asleep and wake up in a year when this should all be over&#8230;I hope.  But I can&#8217;t.  So I&#8217;ll pipe down!</p>
<p>Anyway so Saturday came and went and I was okish by the evening and was looking forward to a fairly decent night&#8217;s sleep.  But then some comedy male &#8216;nurse&#8217; if you could call him that kept appearing!  He was japanese or chinese&#8230;well he was oriental.  Sorry if I offend anyone but I don&#8217;t actually know! Please excuse me for not checking his passport!  I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;s a lovely man and was only doing his job but he kept coming to see me in the night and asking me to pass urine!  You go pee?  You go pee?  YES I&#8217;VE BLOODY PEEED!  I&#8217;VE PEEED FOR 5 DAYS IN CARDBOARD PANS SO JUST LET ME SLEEEEEEEEEEEEP!That&#8217;s what  I wanted to say.  I did not.  I restrained myself!  I really don&#8217;t think he was supposed to be encouraging me to pee quite so often though!  He looked more like a comedy film character than an NHS worker&#8230;a cross between Dumb and Dumber and Jackie Chan!!  He also couldn&#8217;t pronounce the sound &#8216;f&#8217; (he needs to do some phonics with me at school!)  I told him I should be ok to go home in the morning and he said &#8220;Keep your pingers crossed!&#8221;  HAHA pingers!  I&#8217;m not Pingu!  I remember thinking&#8230;&#8217;that would be funny if it wasn&#8217;t stupid o&#8217;clock in the morning and this random man hadn&#8217;t woken me up!&#8217;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sunday</span></strong></p>
<p>Sunday I was homeward bound&#8230;well I hoped to be.  I woke up and I was ok.  Apart from my oriental comedy character filled night&#8217;s sleep I was ok.  Well I was until I tried to move, or eat, or speak, or drink!  Or brush my teeth&#8230;that&#8217;s what tipped me over the edge and the sickness started again!  I kept saying to my mum and Chris yesterday that it just feels like the world&#8217;s worst hangover&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;imagine your WORST hangover&#8230;the WORST one&#8230;you feel sick, you&#8217;ve been sick, will you be sick again?  Your mouth  feels like a manky old skunk or badger or some such creature has crawled into your mouth and done his business in your mouth (the nicest possible way I could think to phrase that!)  Your head is spinning from those shots that you thought were a good idea at the time!  You&#8217;re dizzy, light headed, hot and cold, achey, headache, nauseous&#8230;the lot.  NOW times that by about a million and make it last for DAYS and you&#8217;re nearly there!  Scary thought really as I guess it is similar in a way, my body&#8217;s been pumped full of poison (obviously in the hope to cure me, but in effect it&#8217;s poison) and I guess alcohol is poison in a way (one that tastes good and gives you a good night admittedly!) and this is my body trying to recover from it.  Bizarre thought. </p>
<p>That&#8217;s the other weird thing though, that it&#8217;s not the cancer making me ill.  Anyone who&#8217;s seen me recently will know that.  I was fine.  My knee wasn&#8217;t even THAT bad.  It doesn&#8217;t even hurt right now.  HOW can it be CANCER?  &amp; how weird to know that it&#8217;s not the cancer making me ill, it&#8217;s the treatment.  Which I know everyone knows but when it&#8217;s actually happening to you and you actually think about it, it&#8217;s VERY odd.  They&#8217;re killing everything inside me just to kill the cancer in the tumour, before I can be better.</p>
<p>I keep wondering when my hair will come out.  To be fair I&#8217;ve felt so ill since Saturday I haven&#8217;t been able to wash it so my poor hair probably can&#8217;t wait to leave me &#8211; I&#8217;m not exactly taking care of it!  I almost want it to come out now.  I can understand why people shave it off.  BUT I don&#8217;t think I can.  I&#8217;ll just wait.  Highly bizarre though.  Strange how I used to hate my hair and now I love it.  Please don&#8217;t moan about your hair&#8230;you have hair&#8230;full stop.  &amp; you all have lovely hair&#8230;I&#8217;ve heard all your hair gripes and you&#8217;ve all heard mine.  I won&#8217;t embarrass you but you know who you are&#8230;your fringe is lovely, no it&#8217;s not too long or too short!  No your hair&#8217;s not boring, you don&#8217;t look like a boy!  No your grey hairs don&#8217;t show.  It&#8217;s not too light, no nor too dark.  No it doesn&#8217;t look red.  Yes I love it!!  I love all of your hair!! (donations for wigs accepted!)  I&#8217;m JOKING!  PLEASE DO NOT CUT OFF YOUR HAIR FOR ME!!</p>
<p>Right anyway so Sunday Chris and my mum came to get me quite early in the morning as I thought I was ok and free to go when I wanted to.  But then it was while they were on their way that I got sick.  It was a rubbish day and I felt bad on them&#8230;my dad also came later on. <em>It took til after 7pm until I was OK to leave!  Ooops!</em>  I did have extra injections which they said could make me tired, dizzy etc. and hell they did!  Everyone thought I was asleep and I sort of was but at the same time I could hear them talking and what was going on but I couldn&#8217;t move or speak or anything.  I know that sounds melodramatic but it really was surreal.  There was another comedy &#8216;nurse&#8217; &#8230;an indian guy.  Again I&#8217;m sure he was lovely really but I&#8217;d had enough and again he just seemed to be acting like some random bloke you&#8217;d find in American Pie!  He was dithering and dathering and asking the same questions over and over again&#8230;I&#8217;ll stop now as I&#8217;ll get bitchy but he was hard work!</p>
<p>Anyway Sunday was a haze of sleep and sick and dizziness.  Eventually got to the car (with my huge bag of medication to take home &amp; a car load of my stuff!) &amp; I managed to make it all the way home&#8230;nearly!  We got near to Bramshill I think and I was only bloody sick.  Lovely.  Typical.  I always did that as a kid with travel sickness!  Nice! </p>
<p>Anyway will cut this short now as I&#8217;m dizzy.  Sorry to people who I haven&#8217;t responded to the last few days.  It&#8217;s been a total haze of sickness, weakness and dizziness.  Today I&#8217;ve stayed in bed.  I do want to see you all but today&#8217;s not a good day.  Today is a RED day for those of you who understand traffic lights!  I&#8217;ve also been instructed to do nothing and to avoid people with colds.  Again, it&#8217;s NOT that I don&#8217;t want to see you but if you do have a cold or anything please stay away for me.  I&#8217;m VERY likely to get infections and end up in A&amp;E this week so I want to minimise that as much as possible.</p>
<p>Now I must have a bath.  It&#8217;s been a while&#8230;!  Will write more soon.  Love you all xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</p>
