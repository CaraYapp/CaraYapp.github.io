		<p>Here I am…I’m back!  Sorry I haven’t blogged for soooooooo long, I’ve been receiving lots of complaints!  I think I’ll start charging a fee to read it!!  I guess when I’ve been have bad times and low points I didn’t feel up to blogging and just got bored of talking about myself and my illness and droning on.  Cancer is lots of things…terrifying, shocking, exhausting, painful, life changing…but no-one ever tells you how BORING it is!!  All I have to talk about is my blood count and chemo regime and now surgery stories…I can’t wait to have my life back to have something else to talk about! (not that I’m ever short of things to talk about!!)</p>
<p>Anyway it hasn’t all been bad, I’ll give you a brief history of the last 6 weeks or so.  I finally battled through and made it to chemo 6, the last for a while.  Then…yes you guessed it I went neutropenic and had my usual stay in Frimley Park Hospital.  I was desperate to get to the end of that cos then I was free…well as free as I could be at least for a while!  I had from around 25th August til 8th September to myself!  I wanted to do as much as possible and be as ‘normal’ as possible so I got up everyday, tried to forget I had cancer, put my wig on and went and tried to remember what it was like to be a normal 27 (hate saying that!) year old girl.  So I did what any girl would (or should!) do…I shopped!  I saw friends and family, went out for dinner and went shopping.  I managed to fit in a trip to the theatre to High School Musical 2 with Laura!  No comments please…yes we were the only adults there without children but we were proud of it!  I went for a night away with Chris to the seaside in a lovely hotel near Mudeford.  True English style it was sooooo wet and windy that I had to hold on to my hair!  Literally!  I had a woolly hat to secure it on!  Scary getting so close to losing a £200 wig into the sea!  &#038; I had a mini spa break with Anna too, the place was disappointing (FYI don’t go to Grayshott Spa, it’s a rip off!) but we still had a lovely time and lots of laughs as usual!  It was also lovely to spend some time with my family not in hospital and to know that Goose had a break from being my full-time nurse, PA, waitress etc.!!!  When I saw my nieces after a while of not seeing them, one of them saw me and said “Oh you’re hair’s grown back!”…if only it was that quick!  I love their innocence…plus my wig must be convincing!  My sister and brother in law and nieces came to see me yesterday which was lovely.  That’s the first time the girls have seen me in hospital and the brought me lovely glittery pictures to cheer me up and to stop me getting scared in the night bless them!</p>
<p>So the 8th September came and back came being a cancer patient rather than anything else….at least that’s how it felt.  Back to hospital for tests on my heart and another MRI scan, more needles and not being able to find veins.  Then on the 9th I was admitted to the Nuffield Orthapedic Centre where I would have my surgery the next day.  That evening, on recommendation from one of the nurses, we got takeway!  Domino’s pizza…what better way to prepare for a major op?!  The next morning I was to get ready for surgery first thing and was taken down to theatre by 9am in my attractive hospital gown!  After yet another battle to find veins in my hands and arms and the anaesthetic was in and I was away!  4 hours later and I awoke in recovery.  All I wanted to know was that I still had my leg.  I certainly couldn’t feel it but luckily I could see my toes (my beautifully manicured toes!  Thanks Carrie!  They let me keep it on!)  I was in HDU (high dependency unit…recovery) for HOURS!  Dozing in and out of a drug induced sleep but also wondering where Chris and my parents were and when I would see them and when I would go back to the ward.  Hours and hours passed and eventually my dad found me after 6pm.  No-one had told them where I was or how I was or ait on!)  I was in HDU (high dependency unit…recovery) for HOURS!  Dozing in and out of a drug induced sleep but also wondering where Chris and my parents were and when I would see them and when I would go back to the ward.  Hours and hours passed and eventually my dad found me after 6pm.  No-one had told them where I was or how I was or anything.  Terrible.  So he found me and sat with me for a while. I was so thirsty and there was a beaker I’d been sipping water from through a straw.  I felt absolutely fine and then more suddenly than you could ever believe I felt sick…and was sick!  Very sick…all the water back up again but it tasted like poison…pure poison!  Anyway then I was fine again and after a while my dad went and got Goose and Chris.  I didn’t get back up to my room until nearly 9pm, having been gone 12 hours in all.  Not what I expected  at all!  I thought I’d be back by lunchtime!</p>
<p>Since then has been a long, hard, slow process of being bed bound and trying to make small steps of progress each day and trying to keep positive.   My physio was held back at first as I got a bowel infection.  Not a nice experience being bed bound and having a bowel infection when relying on bed pans…I’ll leave the rest to your imagination!  I really struggled mid week last week to stay positive.  I could never imagine walking again and I guess the reality of all of this hit me again.  After my few weeks of ‘normality’ and trying not to think about the op, it seemed to have suddenly happened and I was stuck in bed unable to move my leg.  It did (and still does) feel like someone has attached a lead weight to my leg.  It doesn’t feel like my leg.  It doesn’t move like my leg.  But I have to keep telling myself it IS my leg and I’m lucky to have kept it at all.  So with help from my mum and dad and Chris and a good long cry and talk with Anna when she came in, I picked myself up again and forced myself to focus on positives and improvements.  Each day saw small steps until my tummy felt better and I was able to leave the room for a few minutes into the corridor on my walking frame.  Then yesterday I walked on crutches for the first time!  It’s hard work and very painful but I did it!  I have to have my leg in a splint before I get up and put any weight on it and my muscles aren’t built up enough yet and my knee would probably give way without the support of the splint.  All this time I’ve been stuck in bed I’ve had a catheter in and then last night I had a visit from a big black man (a nurse!) saying he’d be along to take it out at 5am!  Why on earth it needed to be at 5am I don’t know, his explanation made no sense!  Anyway he left me until 6.15 am and along he came…it was good to get it out but that meant I had to walk to pee!  So with some help from a nurse this morning I managed to get the bathroom on my crutches and go to the toilet and wash in the bathroom rather than in bed.  First time in 12 days!  I’ve just done some more exercises with the physio, I wish someone had told me how hard it’d be and how painful.  She’s coming back later so I can do some walking and she’s bringing me a ‘dog lead’ for me to lift my leg with! I still can’t lift it myself so to get out of bed I have to have someone to lift my leg out for me.  So with this dog lead I should be able to learn how to lift my leg out myself!  Should be interesting! </p>
<p>Well that’s August and September as concise as I could make it…I hope that updates you.  I promise to try and blog more from now on…that’s if anyone’s still reading!  Who are my faithful blog checkers?!…</p>
