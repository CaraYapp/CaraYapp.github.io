		<p>Hello, I&#8217;m here!!  As promised!  Well I&#8217;m back in the hospital in Oxford.  We got here just after 10 am and after a little stop into the wig shop downstairs (which is closing down tomorrow!!) to change my short wig for a better blonde&#8230;the one I had (which I haven&#8217;t worn!) had big black roots on it&#8230;quite natural I suppose for some people!  But my roots were never THAT dark anyway &amp; I never let them get that out of hand!  So I figured if you don&#8217;t have to pay for highlights for years then why have roots?!!  Anyway so after that I was up to the ward probably by 10.30 am and I didn&#8217;t get started on the chemo until about 6.30 pm I think!  So a long day full of waiting&#8230;but I would actually call it a good day.  It&#8217;s frustrating that I&#8217;ve felt my best today than I have for weeks if not months, yet I was in here!  &amp; for no reason really apart from&#8230;w&#8230;a&#8230;i&#8230;t&#8230;i&#8230;n&#8230;g!!  I was at first given a room to myself but just as I started to settle I was told I&#8217;d have to leave it as there were more men coming in.  They don&#8217;t mix men and women in the wards (shame!!) so I had to leave to go into a ward&#8230;or a bay&#8230;of 4 like I was in for my very first chemo&#8230;.seems sooooooooo long ago&#8230;although it&#8217;s sort of gone quickly which is weird.  Anyway I have mixed feelings about the bay&#8230;I&#8217;ve actually really enjoyed it today cos the other ladies are really chatty which helps to pass the time and keep our spirits up and also it&#8217;s really good to hear other people&#8217;s stories and to remind myself that as bad as it all seems, I&#8217;m really not the only one &amp; I&#8217;m not maybe as worse off as I could possibly be&#8230;although it&#8217;s virtually impossible to remember that sometimes&#8230;on my low days or moments&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;anyway whether it&#8217;s drug related&#8230;mood related&#8230;whatever related&#8230;I&#8217;m having a good day.  Although I&#8217;m fully aware and petrified that could change very quickly literally overnight as they&#8217;re pumping all the chemo drugs into me at the moment.  I&#8217;ll have lots of changes of drips overnight so I doubt I&#8217;ll get alot of sleep but I&#8217;m not actually feeling tired either for the first time in weeks&#8230;if not months!!  Yipeeee!  I&#8217;m wide awake&#8230;and in a room where everyone&#8217;s going to sleep!  &amp; although other people can have their benefits during the day&#8230;I think we do have some snorers in our midst!! (is that right?  In our midst?!  It&#8217;s one of those weird saying and I&#8217;m not good with sayings!  I always that them muddled&#8230;.like that don&#8217;t feed the hungry horse that feeds you or whatever it is?!  &amp; then there&#8217;s the gift horse&#8217;s mouth too&#8230;why are they all about horses?!)  Hey we had a weird conversation today sitting out on the roof terrace&#8230;oooooh roof terrace makes it sound like I&#8217;m in some luxurious hotel&#8230;I wish!  Anyway we were talking about mosquitos because Chris had been bitten and I started wondering whether if a mosquito bit me now and sucked my blood whilst my blood&#8217;s full of chemo, would the mosquito get ill or die from the drugs?!  &amp; then I thought well if mosquitos can get cancer then maybe I could cure them by letting them bite me and have some chemo?!!  Hmmmm?!  Now you&#8217;re probably all shaking your heads in dismay (I know my brother will be!) and laughing AT me but I think I&#8217;m onto something here!  We thought about ringing my professor in charge of my treatment but then we thought better of it!  Think he might be too busy to answer our ponderings about bug cancer!  Anyway (got to stop using that word less. this&#8217;ll never get published!) don&#8217;t worry if you&#8217;re starting to get concerned that I&#8217;ve gone crazy&#8230;those of you that know me well enough will know that I always was!  &amp; I might not have much hair left but what is left is very BLONDE so I&#8217;m allowed to have blonde moments!</p>
<p>Right I&#8217;m offski&#8230;this laptop is pretty and pink but keeps doing funny things and I&#8217;m scared I&#8217;ll lose this if I don&#8217;t post it now.  Plus I suppose it&#8217;s nearly Wednesday now&#8230;I don&#8217;t want to go to bed in case tomorrow&#8217;s a bad day- I want to hold onto my good day!</p>
<p>Please post comments comments comments and more comments, even if it&#8217;s one line or whatever.  Don&#8217;t be scared of knowing what to say.  There&#8217;s no right thing to say.  Just say what comes into your head&#8230;that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m doing and enough of you seem to be reading it!  Please keep the emails, calls, texts, messages, cards etc. coming cos they really do spur me on even if a tiny amount when I&#8217;m feeling low.</p>
<p>Night night hope the bed bugs don&#8217;t bite&#8230;.oh NO back to bugs!!  Hope there&#8217;s none in here to start my clinical mosquito chemo trial!  I could be a legendary bug oncologist (that&#8217;s a cancer specialist by the way &#8211; I didn&#8217;t even know the word oncology until I was told I had cancer 2 months ago!)  Right enough of the bugs&#8230;maybe I am doing a little doolally!!</p>
<p>Love you all.  Hope you enjoyed my rambling tonight!xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</p>
