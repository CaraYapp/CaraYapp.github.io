		<p>This week has been nice and busy and full of things I love to do and people I love to see!  The weekend was very wedding orientated&#8230;no, not mine!  On Saturday I went wedding dress shopping with Laura again&#8230;this time Gemma W (her other bridesmaid) and I went with her to Basingstoke&#8230;but there was an accident on the M3 and it took us over 2 hours to get from Fleet to Basingstoke!  The other side of the motorway was totally closed and our side was at a complete standstill so everyone was turning their engines off and getting out of their cars.  I chose not to though, didn&#8217;t fancy hobbling around on my crutches just for the sake of it&#8230;and didn&#8217;t want my wig blowing off on the M3, even if it was a temporary car park at the time!  Instead, us girls passed the time by doing what we do best&#8230;chatting&#8230;and looking at firemen!  Luck was on our side as there was a fire engine right next to us and we found out that if we looked at it long enough, firemen appeared out of it!  &amp; they were not disappointing!  Well, one of them wasn&#8217;t anyway!  I&#8217;ll leave the rest to your imaginations!  Anyway we eventually got there and Laura tried on some beautiful dresses&#8230;like a true princess!  I&#8217;ll say no more as they&#8217;re top secret&#8230;the quest for &#8216;the one&#8217; continues though!  Saturday night was spent with Simon Cowell in the world of X Factor&#8230;Chris was away for the weekend &#8211; he went to stay with his brother in Manchester, although after a night out on the beers with his bro and bro in law, his brother &#8216;wandered off&#8217; which is what he does best after a few drinks, so predictably they didn&#8217;t get home together and Chris had to go home with Darren his bro in law instead, waking up his poor sister Emma!  So I had a very peaceful night&#8217;s sleep!  On Sunday I went with Ollie &amp; Laura (&amp; Gemma) to see the venue for their wedding (Ollie &amp; Laura&#8217;s, not Ollie, Laura &amp; Gemma&#8217;s!)&#8230;it&#8217;s absolutely lovely and really nice to picture now where the big day will be.  Although I&#8217;m now petrified because we&#8217;ve got to walk down a very grand staircase into the room where they&#8217;ll get married&#8230;I&#8217;ll probably trip and create a domino effect knocking Gemma and Laura down the stairs!  &amp; then if Laura&#8217;s trying to steal my wig, we&#8217;ll have a fight!  It&#8217;ll be a memorable day anyway!</p>
<p>Then the highlights of this week have been:</p>
<p>Lunch &amp; the afternoon spent with my sister and the scamps (my nieces!)</p>
<p>A mammoth shopping trip to Primark&#8230;it&#8217;s been far too long so I went a bit crazy!  No guilt involved though as everything&#8217;s so bargainous!  Love that place!</p>
<p>A bit more shopping&#8230;oops!</p>
<p>A dinner out &amp; a good chat with Gemma &amp; Lou</p>
<p>A visit to my Nana, also with Goose, my aunt Corinne, my sister and the scamps again!</p>
<p>A morning making cupcakes and making lots of mess and licking lots of spoons! (I&#8217;ll post photos soon!)</p>
<p>An afternoon with Gillie spent eating the cupcakes and chatting away!&#8230;and giving the grand tour of our lovely house!</p>
<p>&#8230;tonight we&#8217;re having fajitas, mmmm my favourite and watching a film of my choice!  No doubt Chris will be asleep soon anyway as he&#8217;s only just got back from working in Wales.</p>
<p>Tomorrow is back to the world of hospitals for an appointment in clinic with Prof.   Hopefully there&#8217;ll be no surprises and no tears&#8230;but I&#8217;ll take my eyelash glue just in case!  Chemo is on Monday and is now looming&#8230;but I&#8217;ve got lots to look forward to first&#8230;.friends round tomorrow night for some food and games (Wii time!) and then we&#8217;re going away with Ollie &amp; Laura for the weekend to stay with Ally &amp; Emma, so looking forward to that.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got so much in my head I want to write on here, some good, some not so good&#8230;but I&#8217;ll split into day by day so I don&#8217;t bombard you all at once.  Thank  you for my comments, and thanks to the new commenters, I love finding out who&#8217;s been reading!</p>
<p>Love you all xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</p>
