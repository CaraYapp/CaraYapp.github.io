		<p>You&#8217;ll be pleased to know that this post is written:</p>
<p>a) at 1pm, not stupid o&#8217;clock in the morning!</p>
<p>b) I&#8217;m not feeling high or low on drugs!</p>
<p>c) I&#8217;m at home!</p>
<p>After the weekend which was busy sorting things out around the house etc. I went back into Frimley Park Hospital on Monday for a planned blood count check.  As you&#8217;ll know, usually I end up having to stay in, having gone neutropenic and needing IV antibiotics everytime apart from last time, and needing blood transfusions and platelets every time.  This time I was feeling much better and had a good feeling about it&#8230;I was still exhausted but in a different way and more because I&#8217;d been busy and not sleeping rather than just being exhausted from the drugs.  Anyway, I was optimistic and so took less stuff with me (less than the usual car full of pinkness I take!) but I still had to go prepared to stay in so had a few days worth of pj&#8217;s etc.  So Monday was spent in my own room in the private suite, lunch and dinner enjoyed there (poor Goose watching me eat it!) and it got to the evening and we&#8217;d still had no results.  So my sister came in to visit me and Chris was on his way to visit when I was told my blood count was fine and I could go home!  So at about 8.30pm I left!  Chris literally arrived just after I was told so in fact picked me up rather than visited!  It was very bizarre spending the day and evening in the room and then leaving!  Luckily I hadn&#8217;t changed into my pjs as I was feeling better than normal and hopeful that I might be discharged.  So I&#8217;ve been at home all week!  No blood transfusions, no platelets, no drips, no being woken at stupid o&#8217;clock, just home sweet home!  It&#8217;s been lovely to spend time here and to do some of the things I like to do and just to relax.  I&#8217;m still having to take it easy as it&#8217;s still my vulnerable time and I&#8217;ve got to go back tomorrow for another blood count check just in case.  But hopefully that&#8217;ll be fine and I&#8217;m free until 30th November when chemo 10 is due&#8230;apart from 27th November which is another trip to Oxford to see Prof and discuss my progress.</p>
<p>So all in all good news.  I&#8217;m feeling better than I usually do and I&#8217;m at home.  The steroids are finished for a few weeks so I&#8217;m more back to normal.  I&#8217;m making it sound easy  now but it&#8217;s still far from it.  I&#8217;m generally happy and cheerful and just getting on with it, taking each day as it comes but also planning for the days ahead so I can make the most of them.  Yet I&#8217;ve still managed to have some outbursts of tears when the floodgates have opened and I just can&#8217;t stopped&#8230;I can&#8217;t tell you why, there&#8217;s not just one reason.  It&#8217;s just cancer and everything that comes with it and sometimes it just hits me all over again.  Chris usually has the pleasure of this as it&#8217;s usually at night when I lie down to go to sleep when everything comes into my head.  But all girls will know that sometimes you just need a good cry and lots of cuddles and everything seems better after that.  &amp; so that&#8217;s what I did!</p>
<p>Right, well that&#8217;s all for now.  If you&#8217;re on facebook, have a look at my latest pics and the video I&#8217;ve put on my wall.   You will LAUGH!  I&#8217;ve sent it into You&#8217;ve Been Framed, I hope it gets on!  I&#8217;ll try to post it on here soon if I can work it out!</p>
<p>Thanks again for all your messages and comments, more and more of you are coming out of the woodwork!  Like I&#8217;ve said before, I love finding out who&#8217;s reading and I&#8217;ve got back in touch with so many people from years ago because of it, which I love!  So don&#8217;t be shy!</p>
