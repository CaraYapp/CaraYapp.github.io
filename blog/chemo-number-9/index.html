		<p>Well I&#8217;m nearly at the end of chemo number 9 now&#8230;they&#8217;re speeding up the end so I can go home tonight&#8230;YAY!  Although it&#8217;s been reduced AGAIN, it&#8217;s still wiped me out and never fails to surprise me how tired it makes me.  Although compared to the high dose intense chemo I was on before, it&#8217;s nothing!  It&#8217;s all relative though&#8230;</p>
<p>I had a great weekend with lots of laughs and have some funny videos and pics to post on here&#8230;not sure I have the energy at the moment though so I shall try in the next few days when I&#8217;m back home.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got so much I want to write on  here but my brain is always either bursting full of thoughts, feelings, fears etc. or it&#8217;s empty!  There&#8217;s so much going around in there but on the other hand, I&#8217;m so bored of it all and fed up of it, sometimes I just try to wipe it all out&#8230;not often succesfully, there&#8217;s certain things I think about every minute of every day whether I like it or not!  As for how useful my brain is nowadays I&#8217;m really  not sure!  My stubble on my head is looking quite blonde now, so looks like I&#8217;ll have my excuse for my blonde moments back eventually!  It&#8217;s so long now since I&#8217;ve had anything nearly as important or relevant as all that comes with having cancer, I forgotten how to think about anything else!  Although I do try to do brain training on my DS most days&#8230;I go through phases, but my brain age is pretty good nowadays!  &amp; I&#8217;m very good at thinking about, dreaming of and now searching online for holidays for when this is &#8216;over&#8217;&#8230;although I don&#8217;t see how it&#8217;ll ever be truly over at the moment, being in remission is very different from it being over, physically and mentally and I&#8217;m not even there yet.</p>
<p>Anyway great news is that I&#8217;ve been given Christmas back!  Prof said I won&#8217;t have the chemo that I thought I&#8217;d have on 21st December, that they&#8217;ll give me a break for Christmas, YAY!  I was so excited as although I would&#8217;ve been home just in time for Christmas, I would have been exhausted and not able to enjoy it properly, then having to go back into hospital the following week and possibly staying in for New Year&#8217;s Eve.  Not that I&#8217;m a great fan of New Year but I&#8217;d still rather not be in hospital!  But Christmas I LOVE and am soooooooooooooooo excited about it now!  Been doing lots of Christmas shopping online from my hospital bed and making plans for seeing friends and family over the Christmas hols.  I can&#8217;t wait!</p>
<p>Right well I&#8217;m exhausting myself now so off I go&#8230;lunch will be on it&#8217;s way soon, gross!  I hope Goose will arrive soon so she can be something from the cafe downstairs instead!  Goose deserves a medal for how she&#8217;s been there for me this year in sooooo many ways&#8230;and we haven&#8217;t even got annoyed with each other once (well I guess I can only speak for myself on that one!) or had cross words or anything.  She deserves lots of treating and spoiling when I&#8217;m up to doing things for her.</p>
<p>Lots of love and thank you to all my bloggers again, new and old!! xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</p>
