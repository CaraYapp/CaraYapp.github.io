		<p>Hey,</p>
<p>Well today I&#8217;ve been told I can go home!  YAY!  I&#8217;m just waiting for my drugs to come to take home so I can be discharged.  It&#8217;s no wonder I&#8217;m not rattling with all the pills I&#8217;m taking!  I&#8217;m really looking forward to getting home and being &#8216;normal&#8217; for a few days before chemo number 3.  Plus I&#8217;ll be home to watch The Apprentice tonight, yay!  Priorities!  I just want to curl up in my own bed and sleep and sleep and sleep!!</p>
<p>I now have a wig that I LOVE!  &amp; it&#8217;s free on the NHS.  Worth £200!  Amazing really!  They sent me 2 again cos I wasn&#8217;t sure.  When I went to the place I had to try the styles on in really dark colours and choose the colours separately so they could be ordered.  They&#8217;re both gorgeous but one of them&#8217;s a bit too glam and long and I look a bit like Paris Hilton or Sharpay from HSM!  Not quite so natural or practical.  The one I&#8217;m going to keep is a lovely colour, really natural and not so long but still long and shaped really nicely.  Laura, Gemma W, Lou, Katie and Sarah all saw them last night!  We had a bit of a trying on session!  They all think you wouldn&#8217;t know it was a wig if you didn&#8217;t know but I&#8217;m not sure if they&#8217;re just being kind!!  It is amazing though and I do love it.  I&#8217;ve just got to find the guts to wear it now though!  If I make it to Katie&#8217;s party for a bit on Saturday I might have to brave it!  It&#8217;s funny cos I&#8217;ve also got the blonde bob style one that I bought before so now I can choose to have long or short hair and be able to swap in an instant!  Very bizarre!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve now lost a stone on the &#8216;chemo diet&#8217;!!  I wouldn&#8217;t recommend it though!  I don&#8217;t feel like I&#8217;ve lost that much or look like I have but I&#8217;m not surprised with how little I&#8217;ve eaten and how much I&#8217;ve been sick!  Alot of it I think it muscle wasting away too.  My legs seem alot smaller, I think just cos they&#8217;ve barely been used!  I feel like Ariel from The Little Mermaid when she gets legs and is all wobbly and can&#8217;t walk on them!  I wish I was a mermaid &#8211; I was thinking, if I didn&#8217;t have legs I wouldn&#8217;t be able to have a tumour in my leg&#8230;I doubt you can get tumours in a mermaid&#8217;s tail&#8230;.hmmmmmm.  Anyway I&#8217;m either her or bambi on ice!  I&#8217;m going to attempt to walk to the car when I leave which will be a big achievement!  I haven&#8217;t walked further than the toilet for 2 or 3 weeks now!</p>
<p>Yesterday Goose (my mum!) came in and we went on a little adventure around Frimley Park Hospital looking for places to sit outside.  We got an ice cream (which I could only eat a third of&#8230;I&#8217;ve changed!!) and found a little courtyard to sit in.  It was SO nice to be outside as I&#8217;ve missed ALL this amazing weather.  Plus I got dressed for the first time!  It was nice to have a pretty dress on instead of pj&#8217;s&#8230;.although it&#8217;s a good job I love pj&#8217;s cos I&#8217;ve lived in them for weeks!  Primark&#8217;s profits are up thanks to me and my pj shopping recently!</p>
<p>Well I better go and start packing up my room which is full of pinkness!  I&#8217;ve been looking for lovely hotels to go to as me and Chris might go away for a night or 2 on my next so called &#8216;good&#8217; weekend&#8230;just somewhere quiet and peaceful and luxurious not too far away.  I think we just deserve to get away for a few days!</p>
<p>Well lots of love to you all, ciao for now!!</p>
<p>xxx</p>
