		<p>A quick update&#8230;<br />
Last Friday I had my last clinic appointment with Prof and the team for a while.  It was the last one in the cycle that we&#8217;ve known for so long and marked the official end of my chemotherapy.  We had joked for a long time that Prof would get me pink champagne when I got to the end of my treatment &#038; it&#8217;s been an ongoing joke.  Well he actually did!  He produced a lovely bottle of pink moet from under his desk!  I had bought them all pink presents (had to be pink from me!) and made pink cupcakes for them all to have &#038; also a load more of pink cupcakes that I took up to the ward for all the nurses who looked after me &#038; who I&#8217;d grown to know so well in the past year.  It was so strange going up to the ward as a visitor and not as a patient, it all looked so different&#8230;just yet another surreal experience to add to my list!  I wonder when life will STOP being surreal sometimes!  I then took Chris, my mum &#038; dad for lunch at the Compleat Angler in Marlow, which is where we went for lunch on the day I was diagnosed.  It was very strange going back but I felt it was very fitting that I&#8217;d gone full circle, well sort of!  &#038; I wanted to do something to say thank you to them all.  Although I can never thank them enough for how amazing they&#8217;ve been&#8230;I keep trying to!</p>
<p>At the weekend I had a busy one catching up with family &#038; friends and on Sunday we did roast for 12 for Mother&#8217;s Day and had a lovely family filled day.  By Monday I was shattered &#038; needed to admit defeat that I&#8217;d been overdoing it and needed to rest&#8230;but I couldn&#8217;t do that as I had to go back to Oxford again to see the surgeon this time and have some more scans.  I&#8217;ve been in a lot of pain with my knee for a long time and had just become use to it and almost resigned to the fact that that&#8217;s how it would be now&#8230;especially with the chemo still going on, I was never strong enough to do anything about it, I just put up with it!  But recently I&#8217;ve come to realise that actually I can&#8217;t and shouldn&#8217;t have to live with such pain and that really I should get it checked out.  Hence an earlier than planned return visit to see the surgeon.  He was very quick to diagnose the problem when I described it and he examined my leg.  I can&#8217;t remember what he called it now, I will look it up again at some point, but basically it&#8217;s my knee cap grinding against and clashing with the metal prosthesis that&#8217;s causing the pain and the &#8216;crunching&#8217; when I straighten and bend my leg.  It&#8217;s not uncommon apparently and hopefully when my muscles strengthen enough, they will pull the knee cap back away from the prosthesis and this should stop happening.  So basically it&#8217;s good news that it&#8217;s nothing more complicated but the bad news is I have to put up with the pain until it goes away, which means taking painkillers and working through the pain to crack on with my physio exercises to strengthen all the muscles and get them working properly again.  At least I can focus on this properly now that there&#8217;s no more chemo.  By Tuesday I really was exhausted and I slept practically all day.  I haven&#8217;t been sleeping well at all recently and I&#8217;ve been overdoing things, constantly with the mindset that I want to do this, that &#038; the other as I always feel like my freedom&#8217;s going to be taken away from me again at any moment, which of course all being well won&#8217;t happen, but that&#8217;s where my mind still seems to be at!</p>
<p>Yesterday was my middle niece Daisy&#8217;s 5th Birthday so I went round there for her birthday tea which was lovely as always!  Then I went to a concert last night so today was supposed to be a day of rest but I&#8217;ve been busy at home washing, ironing, tidying etc.  Chris will be impressed!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m absolutely shattered but enjoying being busy and getting some &#8216;normality&#8217; back in my life.  It&#8217;s amazing how enjoyable doing the ironing, having a bath or a shower, just normal everyday things can be when you know what it&#8217;s like to have it all taken away from you.  BUT no I don&#8217;t enjoy ironing THAT much and no I won&#8217;t be doing any of yours so please nobody start dropping it round!<br />
Right that&#8217;s all for now folks, back soon xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</p>
