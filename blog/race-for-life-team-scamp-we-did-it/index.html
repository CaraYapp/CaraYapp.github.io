		<p>Hi all,<br />
I&#8217;m not sure if anyone will still be reading this but here I am just in case!  I have been &#8216;told off&#8217; a few times recently by people telling me I should still be writing&#8230;oops, sorry!  I always intend to but I&#8217;m happy to say that I&#8217;ve just been too busy with non-cancer related things to come on here!  Also, I think who would want to read it now, when (hopefully!) all the drama is over!  But, anyway, I&#8217;m told that there are people out there who are still interested and don&#8217;t get to hear my updates in other ways or see me so here I am!</p>
<p>The last few months have been busy with holidays, preparing to get back to work, fundraising, wedding planning, more holidays, more fundraising and trying to find some kind of normality&#8230;.combined with LOTS of physio, it doesn&#8217;t leave much time for me to blog!  I&#8217;m also finding it hard to find the right balance between being busy and resting and find myself exhausted regularly after I&#8217;ve been over-doing it!  But I&#8217;m making up for lost time!</p>
<p>This will only be a short post as today is one of my exhausted days and I&#8217;ll use this as a tester to see if anyone comments or gets in touch&#8230;then if you want more, I&#8217;ll write more!!</p>
<p>Yesterday was a big day for me.  I did Race for Life, which I&#8217;ve been determined to do since last year when friends &#038; family did it as TEAM SCAMP and I was unable to even go to watch as I was stuck in hospital.   So I&#8217;ve been working hard on physio to strengthen my leg and improve my walking and I did it!  TEAM SCAMP was much bigger this year, lots of my friends and family were there to support me so  I&#8217;m so grateful to them and lucky to have such a huge support.  Plus everyone who&#8217;s sponsored us too&#8230;we&#8217;re on £2266 at the moment and this still seems to be increasing&#8230; it&#8217;s not too late to sponsor us at www.raceforlifesponsorme.org/teamscamp2010 &#8211; every penny counts!!</p>
<p>I also did a pink party and fundraiser about 6 weeks ago to celebrate my survival and raise money.  That also raised nearly £2000 which I&#8217;ve split between Cancer Research, Macmillan, Bone Cancer Research Trust and Sarcoma UK.</p>
<p>So, I&#8217;m not too far off being a fundraising manager the last few months and it&#8217;s made me realise it&#8217;s hard work but I really enjoy doing it and it&#8217;s really satisfying when you know what a good cause you&#8217;re working towards and how important the money is to these charities&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;but now I&#8217;m going to have to put fundraising aside for a while as I need to focus on getting back to teaching.  The plan is for me to start back in September on a phased return probably starting with just 3 half days and gradually increasing.  This may sound pathetically easy to all you healthy people, and part of my mind still thinks it seems so easy, but the rest of my mind and my body is petrified that I&#8217;ll even be able to manage that after all I&#8217;ve been through!  &#038; being in charge of 30 8 year old&#8217;s learning, well-being, enjoyment etc. is not an easy job by any means!  But another part of me is equally excited as I am petrified so time will tell and we&#8217;ll see how it goes.  My headteacher and my school are being really supportive and flexible so that&#8217;ll help a huge amount in my return to work.  This Friday I&#8217;ll meet my class and teach them for an hour with the other teacher I&#8217;ll be sharing my class with, eeeeeeeek!!  Wish me luck!!</p>
<p>Right, that&#8217;s all for now as my brain and body are tired!  If there&#8217;s anyone reading this, I hope you&#8217;re doing well and enjoying the sunshine, this summer&#8217;s weather seems too good to be true!!</p>
