		<p>Well here I am&#8230;vertical&#8230;as in not horizontal!Â  Well when I say vertical, I only mean semi&#8230;I still can&#8217;t stand up much or for long!Â  I&#8217;m not sure when exactly it became an achievement to get downstairs but now it is and I did it!Â  Instead of the day spent it bed it was mainly spent on the sofa and lots of sitting not just lying&#8230;Â  &amp; in tracky bottoms instead of PJ&#8217;s! Wahoo!Â  It&#8217;s strange at the moment, not sure if I feel like a toddler or an old lady but I&#8217;m definitely more like a 2 year old or a 90 year old&#8230;certainly don&#8217;t feel like a 26 year old anymore!Â  But how many of you can say you had a more excitingÂ day than me???Â  Oh&#8230;all of you, ok!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still not feeling veryÂ human but definetely alotÂ better than I was.Â  Tastebuds doing strange things&#8230; mouth feels like it&#8217;s full of little demons nibbling at my gums!Â  I&#8217;ve got special mouthwash to help but it&#8217;s due to get alot worse with ulcers etc. to be expected from the chemo.Â  Am a bit sicky but haven&#8217;t been sick since Sunday as am on soooo many anti-sickness and steroids.Â  Still very dizzy and tired and wobbly and just not right&#8230;but have progressed alot just throughout the day&#8230;my mum&#8217;s been babysitting while Chris is at work&#8230;it&#8217;s very cute, they do little handovers!!Â  Again, am I 2 or 90?Â  I&#8217;m not sure but I&#8217;m very well looked after and very lucky that&#8217;s for sure.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t been this perky all day though, trust me&#8230;Â  This morning I wanted to just keep closing my eyes and hoped that eventually I&#8217;d open them and realise it was all a dream.Â  So I could roll over and tell Chris my ridiculous dream and he&#8217;d laugh at me!Â  Obviously not &#8230;but it still seems possible somehow that it&#8217;s not real&#8230;Â  Before, when I found out,Â it seemed real and I was facing it and being positive.Â  Now I&#8217;ve got all this time just to do nothing and rest, it seems impossible.Â  They must&#8217;ve made a mistake?Â  My knee DOESN&#8217;T EVEN HURT!!Â  Then I go through that in my head and face that it&#8217;s real again but just wish that this one round of chemo could be it.Â  The thought of 5 more and THEN surgery, rehab, physio, and THEN MOOOOOREEE chemo just makes me want to give up right now.Â  Which is why all the advice is for small steps which is how I have to focus.Â  Literally day by day at the moment.Â  Am already dreading 2 weeks today though being admitted again and pumped full of it all over again&#8230;.</p>
<p>Still no hair loss yet.Â  I&#8217;ve got the silk pillow cases on now&#8230;recommended by Anna&#8230;purchased via ebay.Â  I swear if this is ever a published book, ebay will have to sponsor me or pay for the privilige of being mentioned so much!Â  Seriously actually, if you&#8217;re into buying shares, buy some in ebay &#8211; they&#8217;re about to soar!Â  Think our postman&#8217;s going to be straining his arms with all the parcels that are arriving!Â  Like I keep saying, ebay should be banned for cancer patients who are diagnosed and left unsupervised all night with internet access&#8230;from bed!!Â  Anyway&#8230;silk pillow cases!Â Â  They&#8217;re supposed to mean less hair falls out at night because they don&#8217;t tug&#8230;they won&#8217;t stop the hair loss but should mean it&#8217;s less upsetting in the mornings as that&#8217;s often when alot falls out.Â  Plus apparently they&#8217;re great for your skin so even if I do look like Uncle Fester or Duncan Goodhew, I&#8217;ll have lovely skin!!Â  They feel lovely&#8230;although Chris isn&#8217;t using them&#8230;I did offer but we both agreed he probably wouldn&#8217;t appreciate them so much!Â  I did have a scare this morning though!Â  We were lying in bed&#8230;.after my 3 billion attempts at closing my eyes and pretending it was I dream&#8230;I had to face reality and talk about it!Â  My hair (although I had it cut short is still fairly long round the front) was flopped on the pillow and Chris went to grab a bit of fluff or something and I jumped out of my skin!!!Â  I thought he was just going to pick up the clump of hair I could see out of the corner of my eye!Â  I thought it was just lying there!Â  Anyway&#8230;it was still attached&#8230;firmly!Â  &amp; Chris got the bit of fluff successfully!Â  But that&#8217;s what&#8217;s soooooo weird&#8230;obviously I BELIEVE them that it&#8217;ll fall out (YES it will.Â  I know with some chemo it doesn&#8217;t but apparently what I&#8217;m having is alot and it&#8217;s agressive chemo and lots of it and it will fall out pretty soon&#8230;)&#8230;but at the moment I just can&#8217;t imagine it&#8230;I can TUG TUG TUG at it and it&#8217;s not coming!Â  One of these days I&#8217;ll be saying to someone &#8220;Look at this, TUG TUG TUG and it doesn&#8217;t fall ou&#8230;..oooops&#8230;aaaah loooooook!!!!&#8221;Â  Who will be the lucky person?!</p>
<p>While we&#8217;re on the subject of hair I have to share some funny comments Chris made when we first found out about this (still only 2 weeks ago!)Â  To be fair to him, he was VERY tired and half asleep in bed and I was obviously chatter chatter chattering&#8230;.just a normal night in the Yapp/Newton household!!Â  Only this time it was different because that day I&#8217;d be told I&#8217;d got cancer.Â  Now don&#8217;t go all silly and think he was being insensitive because he wasn&#8217;t and he&#8217;s been and is being truly amazing.Â  This was just a &#8216;weak&#8217; moment after hours of saying the right thing and comforting me!!Â  So instead of letting him sleep, my verbal diarrhoea continued&#8230;.YAPP YAPP YAPP!!Â  So there I am thinking about all the trivial things that come into your head after about 12 hours of knowing you&#8217;ve got cancer&#8230;</p>
<p>Me (wide awake): &#8220;Oh no, now I won&#8217;t be able to use any lovely shampoos or anything!&#8221;Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â </p>
<p>Chris (half asleep): &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry baby, you might still want to use them on your skull&#8221;Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â </p>
<p>Me (a insy bit mad by now!): &#8220;What do you MEAN, my SKULL?!!Â  I&#8217;m not going to be a skeleton, there&#8217;ll still be skin, I&#8217;ll still have a scalp!!&#8221;Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â </p>
<p>Him (very confused&#8230;and sorry!): &#8220;Oh no, scalp, I meant scalp, not skull, scalp, sorry baby, sorry scamp, baaaaaaaby&#8230;..&#8221;Â  I&#8217;ll leave the grovelling out!</p>
<p>Anyway then a few minutes later (I forgive easily and we laughed alot&#8230;or maybe that wasn&#8217;t til the next day we laughed!!) he&#8217;s back in his sleepy daze and I&#8217;m back in my &#8216;wired&#8217; state of confusion and knowing I&#8217;m not going to get ANY sleep (cue ebay!!)&#8230;and I&#8217;m off again:</p>
<p>Me (remember I&#8217;ve just forgiven him for the skull comment!) &#8220;I won&#8217;t be able to wear a wig ALL the time, they might be hot, they might be itchy, they might look awful&#8221;Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â </p>
<p>Chris (nearly asleep again!) : &#8220;Well baby, you don&#8217;t know, you might not always want to wear wigs, you might end up wearing balaclavas lots of the time&#8221;Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â<br />
Me (is he trying to piss me off!): &#8220;BALACLAVAS???? WHY the HELL would I want to wear BALACLAVAS???Â  I&#8217;m going to have chemo not become a friggin (doubt I said friggin!!) bank robber?!!!&#8221;<br />
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â<br />
Him (in sleepy daze&#8230;uh oh!): &#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?Â  What did I say?Â  What&#8217;s wrong?!&#8221;</p>
<p>He meant BANDANAS.Â  NOT balaclavas.Â  He&#8217;s special&#8230;very special!!Â  Ha ha no but seriously he may well kill me for putting this on here&#8230;but along with him and my bro asking about &#8216;viewing&#8217; times, I have to include these things.Â  &amp; if I can&#8217;t be cheeky and take the p**s out of everyone now, then when can I?!Â  There has to be some perks&#8230;.although I&#8217;m not sure who I&#8217;m kidding as I did it before anyway&#8230;just got an extra excuse now!Â  Anyway I could be doing ANYTHING on here now, anything&#8217;s possible when Arsenal v Man U is on TV&#8230;even when your boyfriend supports Liverpool!Â  Hee hee he&#8217;ll tell me off for that too as to be fair he is cooking me dinner at the same time.Â  Love him.Â  I know those of you who know him don&#8217;t need me to say it, but he I am truly lucky to have him by my side through this and his strength and support in this, along with that of my family and friends, will get me through this&#8230;.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to cry now and lots of people keep telling me off for making me cry on here too&#8230;but I hope you&#8217;ve laughed more than cried tonight&#8230;that is if you&#8217;re still reading!Â  Keep making comments on here, I am reading them and appreciate each and every one of them.Â Â  So please do comment even if you&#8217;re unsure or don&#8217;t know me that well or think you might upset me.Â  It doesn&#8217;t matter, just do it.Â  (&amp; if you&#8217;reÂ a publisher, or an editor of a magazine who would be interested in me as a collumnist then really, please DO comment, don&#8217;t be shy!!)</p>
<p>Thank you so much also to everyone who&#8217;s generously donated to Chris and Robin&#8217;s half marathon for cancer research&#8230;we&#8217;re already up to Â£1165 which is unbelievable and we&#8217;re far from plaguing all of our contacts yet&#8230;so watch out!Â  No seriously though, if you&#8217;d like to sponsor them, go toÂ <a href="http://www.justgiving.com/robinandchris">http://www.justgiving.com/robinandchris</a> and every little helps.Â  If you&#8217;ve got any fundraising ideas for cancer charities that you&#8217;d like to do but feel you don&#8217;t have time, let me know!Â  I can be a fundraising manager from my bed&#8230;I&#8217;m sure all my charms and persuasions won&#8217;t go with my hair&#8230;I&#8217;ll be able to sweet talk some sponsors!</p>
<p>Until tomorrow&#8230;night night<br />
