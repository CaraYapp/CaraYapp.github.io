		<p>&#8230;that&#8217;s what the leaflet from the steroids I&#8217;m on tells me I could be (alongside the other 3,000 possible side effects!)  I&#8217;ve pretty much given up reading leaflets for my medications as they all tell you an endless list of possible side effects, most of which I&#8217;ve already got happening from the chemo or other medication and am trying to get rid of!  So reading them usually just turns into a waste of time!  But now that I&#8217;m awake at 1.31 am and don&#8217;t want to be awake, I&#8217;m wondering why!  &amp; remembering that I&#8217;ve been on more steroids the last few days than usual and that as Goose read the leaflet to me while I got up this morning, she said they could make my hyperactive, or depressed, or swing between the 2!  Lovely!  Alongside the hot flushes, increased appetite and weight gain, I&#8217;m a right catch at the moment!  Surely that&#8217;s a sure fire recipe for depression anyway &#8211; can&#8217;t sleep, fat and sweaty!  Mmmmm attractive!</p>
<p>Anyway I&#8217;m on here because I can&#8217;t sleep.  I think I have actually been quite hyperactive the last few days, whether it&#8217;s the drugs or a natural high because I don&#8217;t feel as bad as I normally do, I don&#8217;t know.  I&#8217;m much, much better than I usually am at this point after chemo, probably due to another reduction in one of the chemo drugs.  I&#8217;m still booked in to hospital on Monday though to be checked as no risks can be taken as you never know what&#8217;s around the corner, that&#8217;s for sure!  I&#8217;ve also managed to go shopping today which always helps with hyperactivity!  &amp; been to physio and been told I can walk on just 1 crutch (or crunch for those of you who read about that!) from now on!  So all in all quite a productive day&#8230;lots of Christmas shopping done already which is unheard of for me this early!  But now here I am, should be exhausted&#8230;AM exhausted in fact, but can&#8217;t sleep.</p>
<p>My brain is working overtime.  I feel like I&#8217;m in a movie&#8230;the wind and the rain is crashing around outside, blowing a gale.  If this was a film or a book it would be written like that to depict my frame of mind&#8230;the gale outside, the thoughts in my head!  But don&#8217;t worry I won&#8217;t go down that road or get that deep!</p>
<p>I think the main reason my mind can&#8217;t turn off tonight is something I haven&#8217;t shared on here before.  It&#8217;s something anyone who&#8217;s been on this journey with me will know about and will know how soul destroying it is for me.  It&#8217;s the fact that on 20th April when I was told I had cancer, that wasn&#8217;t actually what upset me the most.  Not the thought of losing my hair or having my life as I knew it crash around me.  Not the fear of whether I&#8217;d keep my leg, or live or die.  I&#8217;d prepared myself for all of that in a weird way&#8230;during the weeks from the biopsy to hearing the results I&#8217;d been through all the &#8216;what ifs&#8217;, the devestation, the &#8216;why me?&#8217;, the scouring the internet for information on bone cancer that might make me feel better, but of course didn&#8217;t give me what I wanted to hear.  I think I was better prepared for the diagnosis than anyone else because I JUST KNEW.  I really did just know that it was going to be cancer.  But what I didn&#8217;t know and hadn&#8217;t prepared myself for in any way was to be told that the chemotherapy was to be so intense that it would be highly likely to leave me infertile.  This shocked and knocked and devestated me more than anything.  The conversation in that room about my future fertility was a short one, with so much other information to take in.  But it was a simple one.  Prof clearly said that it would take 6 weeks to harvest my eggs and we didn&#8217;t have time because I needed to start the chemo asap.  My dad, knowing and seeing how much having children means to me, asked &#8216;what if Cara does decide to harvest eggs and wait the 6 weeks?&#8217;  Prof simply answered &#8216;We&#8217;d be talking about Cara&#8217;s life.&#8217;  As in risking it.  I just could not speak at this point.  Something that doesn&#8217;t happen very often!</p>
<p>So&#8230;there we are.  That&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve found hardest to deal with I think to be honest, although there&#8217;s no possible way of ordering what&#8217;s hardest about coping and living with this evil disease and such intense treatment and life change.  Anyone who knows me at all will know how much I love and adore children and that having a family of my own has always been THE most important thing to me.  &amp; not to sound too soppy but since meeting Chris and us being so right, those feelings have only got stronger.  Since an early time in our relationship we&#8217;ve joked and dreamed about our little family one day&#8230;3 kids and Barney (our future St Bernard!)  We have our little jokes about whether they&#8217;ll be boys or girls but in our hearts of course all we want is to have children of our own&#8230;or even just a child of our own.   We&#8217;ve talked about it lots and both agree that when the time comes we&#8217;ll do ANYTHING we can to make it happen&#8230;and if all else fails we would look into adoption.  Chris tells me we need to take one thing at a time and I know he&#8217;s right.  He tells me I just need to focus on getting better first and then on enjoying life and having some &#8216;me&#8217; time and then we&#8217;ll look to the future and deal with whatever comes our way.  If we can get through this, we can get through anything.  &amp; I know he&#8217;s right and he&#8217;s so practical and positive about things, it&#8217;s amazing.  But me being me, and being female, I can&#8217;t be that practical all of the time as emotions get in the way!  I tell myself not to worry or think about it and I&#8217;m not letting it take over or anything as I do think I&#8217;m managing very well.  BUT&#8230;there&#8217;s not a single minute of a single day that it isn&#8217;t on my mind in some way.  With something so important to me potentially being taken away all because of this stupid illness that&#8217;s come from nowhere and is no-one&#8217;s fault&#8230;well there&#8217;s just no answers to any of it are there?!  But what I do know and think of ALL the time, is that it could be worse.  I&#8217;m not the worse off that I could be, like I keep saying I&#8217;ve got fantastic support from SO many people and an amazing life other than Cancer and all that comes with it.  Which is more than you could possibly imagine.  But I do count myself lucky lots of times everyday, no matter how down the rest of it gets me, I&#8217;m still here and I&#8217;m still smiling (mostly!)</p>
<p>Right, I&#8217;ll cheer up now.  On a positive note, I&#8217;ve heard of lots of absolutely amazing stories of girls who have been through similar illnesses and treatments to me and have even been categorically told that they&#8217;ll be infertile, yet have gone on to conceive naturally and now have happy, healthy children!  It&#8217;s stories like that I have to keep in my mind, to give me hope.  &amp; I haven&#8217;t been told categorically NO, just HIGHLY UNLIKELY.  Well, if I&#8217;m rare enough to get this type of cancer in the first place, I figure I&#8217;m rare enough to be a mummy against all odds!  Think we&#8217;ll forget 3 &#8211; let&#8217;s go for 6, 3 sets of twins!  EEEEK!</p>
<p>Sorry for the heaviness of this post.  I&#8217;ve been feeling for a while like I wanted to share this, but it&#8217;s a scary thing to talk (type!) about as it just means so much and makes me feel so fragile&#8230;but  I talk about it alot openly though so I figure why not do the same on here as it seems to be helping me and others to get through this, so why not!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll leave you now and promise (well I&#8217;ll try!) to make my next post more cheerful!&#8230;</p>
<p>FYI it&#8217;s only 41 days until Christmas!  &amp; I&#8217;m VERY excited already!  If that doesn&#8217;t make you smile, you&#8217;re a SCROOGE and you should cheer up and get in the festive spirit!</p>
<p>Love xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</p>
<p>P.S. It&#8217;s now 2.09 am and I&#8217;m still wide awake!  I want to catch some zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz <img src="../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":-(" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
