		<p>Good evening!  Well like the title says it&#8217;s Wednesday evening now&#8230;by now I&#8217;m usually curled up in a ball sleeping, not talking (seriously &#8211; me not talking!), not eating and being sick.  This time I&#8217;ve been chatting (yes back to being me!) and eating like a horse (not a gift horse or a hungry horse or any of those silly sayings!) and not been or felt sick at all&#8230;TOUCH WOOD&#8230; I really don&#8217;t want to curse this as after another sleepless night with 4 different chemos going in it could be a very different story on the sickness front tomorrow&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;I&#8217;m really glad I stayed on this ward today and didn&#8217;t go into my own room cos the day&#8217;s gone really quickly with other people around.  &amp; I&#8217;ve been keeping myself busy chatting online and emailing and I&#8217;ve taken to colouring now!  I find it really therapeutic and addictive so it&#8217;s working for me at the moment &amp; anything that works is worth a try!  I&#8217;ve reverted to being a child (some of you may think that hasn&#8217;t been much of a transformation!) with my new colouring books and pencils and taking my bear everywhere!  I will post a photo of my bear on here soon as he started off naked as bears often are!  He&#8217;s now got a Team Scamp t-shirt on (it&#8217;s an early baby one!  Anna made it for him bless her!  Thanks scampi!!)  Anna will have so much to read and catch up on when she gets back as she&#8217;s away for 2 weeks at the moment and I&#8217;m missing her lots but texting lots!  Anyway so today was another good day and has gone really quickly.  My mum&#8217;s been with me during the day as always which is always lovely company.  Chris came this evening after working in Wales bless him and Gemma W and Chris O came to see me too which was lovely as I haven&#8217;t seen them for ages.  I haven&#8217;t seen lots of people for ages cos I haven&#8217;t been up to it for so long but I&#8217;m feeling better now than I have for a long time&#8230;let&#8217;s hope I&#8217;m not jinxing it by going on about it!</p>
<p>Thank you for all your comments those of you who wrote them and everyone who&#8217;s let me know you&#8217;re reading&#8230;sounds like there&#8217;s a fair few addicts out there!  What will you do when I&#8217;m better?!  I&#8217;m not looking forward to tonight as it&#8217;s all the drug changes again all through the night so I won&#8217;t get much sleep again and I&#8217;m just not feeling tired for the first time in weeks if not months, I actually feel quite hyper!  It must be all the food&#8230;.my doctor told me today to eat as much junk as I can!!  OK!!  It&#8217;s jaffa cakes I&#8217;m addicted to at the moment!  &amp; pasta!  Funny how things change all the time&#8230;</p>
<p>Anyway night night I hope I&#8217;ll be back tomorrow&#8230;if not you&#8217;ll know I&#8217;ve deteriorated overnight&#8230;here&#8217;s hoping NOT!</p>
<p>Love and hugs</p>

					<p>Good to see you last night Mrs Scamp, hope you&#8217;re still feeling well, munching down on plenty of greasy unhealthy nom noms and indulging in much colouring!!! Really need to sort out my own JustGiving page but am deliberating doing a week cycling to work in addition to all the Grim stuff at the moment&#8230; can&#8217;t have Dave beating me with his &#8216;trilogy&#8217; of events.<br />
Take care,<br />
Ol<br />
