		<p>Ola!  (that&#8217;s hi in Portuguese in case you didn&#8217;t know!)  Yes, that&#8217;s right I&#8217;m in Portugal so you should feel very priviliged that I&#8217;m writing a post while I&#8217;m here!  There&#8217;s one reason for this&#8230;it seems the sun has gone to my head and turned me to writing poetry!  I couldn&#8217;t sleep last night &amp; after finding a notebook to starting writing chapters for my book (yes, that&#8217;s write, it&#8217;s now officially a work in progress!  Even if it&#8217;s never published &amp; never read, I still want to write it)  Anyway, so that&#8217;s what I was doing, when this kind of poured out of my head and onto the page.  Now, I know what you&#8217;re thinking&#8230;no I&#8217;m not a secret poet and I haven&#8217;t been writing poems secretly all this time.  It just came from nowhere and I don&#8217;t know why but it did so I thought I&#8217;d share it.  &amp; don&#8217;t be too harsh on me as I haven&#8217;t written a poem EVER unless being told to, i.e. at school so I&#8217;m reckoning it&#8217;s been at LEAST 10 years, probably more like 15!</p>
<p>Anyway&#8230;right&#8230;here goes&#8230;</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t know it &#8216;d be this bad</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t know I would feel this sad</p>
<p>Filling my thoughts everyday</p>
<p>Sometimes not having anything to say</p>
<p>Fearing and dreading it&#8217;s not too late</p>
<p>This can&#8217;t be it.  This can&#8217;t be my fate.</p>
<p>Too much for live for.  There must be more&#8230;</p>
<p>I need to be here with those I adore.</p>
<p>Will I wake up?  Will I see them again?</p>
<p>Why can&#8217;t somebody stop this pain?</p>
<p>At the end of this tunnel there must be a light</p>
<p>I have to keep going.  I must keep up this fight.</p>
<p>I want to be here another day&#8230;week&#8230;month&#8230;year</p>
<p>My eyes fill each minute with tear after tear.</p>
<p>Surrounded by so much care, so much love</p>
<p>I want to stay here, not look down from above.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The poison inside me is making me sick</p>
<p>I have to endure it.  It&#8217;s my life I pick.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not an inspiration.  I don&#8217;t feel brave.</p>
<p>But I have to beat this.  Too young for a grave.</p>
<p>How do I beat it?  I&#8217;m not fighting a war</p>
<p>The hurting inside me, emotions so raw.</p>
<p>Take it all out, leave me a scar</p>
<p>Life, to me, still seems so so far</p>
<p>Chemo and sickness and hospital beds</p>
<p>Hairloss and headscarves and hospital beds</p>
<p>The look on their faces screams &#8216;oh she&#8217;s so young&#8217;</p>
<p>Guarding me, above me, angels are hung.</p>
<p>Always believing what&#8217;s meant to be will be</p>
<p>But still the wondering then why is it me?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So much to lose.  So many reasons to care,</p>
<p>How is this happening?  How is this fair?</p>
<p>Look to the sunlight.  Leave the shadows behind.</p>
<p>Around the corner you don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;ll find.</p>
<p>Day after day reaching closer to the end&#8230;</p>
<p>How will I cope?  I&#8217;ll still need a friend.</p>
<p>Rebuilding my future.  Learning to walk.</p>
<p>Planning for happy times.  Loving to talk.</p>
<p>Nothing ventured, nothing gained</p>
<p>But those all around me so hurt and so pained.</p>
<p>Inside and out I&#8217;m not who I was.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s time to show this cancer who&#8217;s boss.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Deep down all I want is to be me</p>
<p>To live my life and to be free.</p>
<p>This is no journey down a country lane,</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a rollercoaster ride on a runaway train.</p>
<p>No looking back.  No letting go&#8230;</p>
<p>For a rollercoaster, why is it so slow?</p>
<p>Scan after scan.  Test after test.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m trying so hard.  I&#8217;m trying my best.</p>
<p>Keep trying to smile.  Stay &#8216;positive&#8217;</p>
<p>Why won&#8217;t it leave me?  I just want to live.</p>
<p>No pausing for breathe.  My mind cannot rest.</p>
<p>Please cancer do not spread to my chest.</p>
<p>Keep away from my lungs.  Let them be clear.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve lasted this long.  It&#8217;s been a whole year.</p>
<p>Can I look to the future, leave this in the past?</p>
<p>Wish I knew how long these feelings would last&#8230;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Chemo over but not hip hip hooray&#8230;</p>
<p>Why am I feeling I wish I could stay?</p>
<p>A cancer patient has been my job for so long,</p>
<p>Can I move on?  Can I keep being strong?</p>
<p>So many loved ones who I know are there,</p>
<p>Whether or not I have any hair!</p>
<p>Letters and cards and parcels in the post,</p>
<p>What is it that I&#8217;ll miss the most?</p>
<p>Worry that people now think I&#8217;m alright,</p>
<p>But still lonely and lost in the cold of the night.</p>
<p>IT&#8217;s left me broken and battered and worn,</p>
<p>But I won&#8217;t be beaten.  To Chris I have sworn.</p>
<p>Our future together forever we&#8217;ll stay.</p>
<p>Living, laughing, loving day after day.</p>
<p>Soon to be Mrs I&#8217;ll walk down to aisle&#8230;</p>
<p>Seeing him there, making me smile.</p>
<p>A family of our own, always our dream,</p>
<p>Whatever happens, we&#8217;ll still be a team.</p>
<p>But please cancer, don&#8217;t take our dream away&#8230;</p>
<p>All we can do is to hope and to pray.</p>
<p>With all said and done, it is what it is&#8230;</p>
<p>But life before cancer I always will miss.</p>
<p>I may feel I&#8217;ve been changed inside and out</p>
<p>But life is for living.  That&#8217;s what it&#8217;s about</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And that&#8230;I promise&#8230;I never will doubt&#8230;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So there you are.  My life since cancer in a poem.  I never thought I&#8217;d be writing that!  But then I never thought a lot of things would happen &amp; they have, so I&#8217;ve stop trying to figure out or imagine what might happen next and learnt just to enjoy the day for what it is.  Precious.</p>
<p>My poem doesn&#8217;t have a title because to be honest why does it need one?!  &amp; I didn&#8217;t start with a title because I didn&#8217;t know I was writing it until it appeared on the page!  But if you think it needs a title, post your ideas here! &#8230;</p>
<p>&amp; if you think the poem&#8217;s a load of crap&#8230;keep it to yourself!!</p>
<p>Love and sunshine (I won&#8217;t be too smug, it&#8217;s due to rain Sunday!) xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</p>
