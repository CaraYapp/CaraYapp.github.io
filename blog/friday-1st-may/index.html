		<p>OK, now I won&#8217;t write loads but as I had to do Thursday in hindsight, I don&#8217;t want to get really behind!  Yesterday (Friday) was better.  I had chemo changes all night but then in the morning after the last change I managed to get some more sleep which I really needed.  My mum and dad came back and Linda and Barry came too (Chris&#8217;s parents)  It was lovely to see them all but not sure how lovely it is for people to see me!!  I&#8217;ve been really swollen and puffy&#8230;attractive!  I&#8217;ve only gone and put on weight!  But no, before you think it, I&#8217;m not the only person ever to defy medical science and put weight ON during chemo!!  They say it&#8217;s normal and expected, it&#8217;s from all the fluid being pumped into me and also the steroids&#8230;so they keep giving me something to make me pee more!  I just love being made to pee MORE when have to wheel my stupid chemo trolley across to the toilet, write my bed number onto a cardboard pan and leave my pee to be collected to be measured and tested!  Yes everytime!  When I get home I won&#8217;t know what to do &#8211; I&#8217;ll be asking Chris to collect it!!  No. not REALLY!</p>
<p>Sickness&#8230;</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t actually been sick yet but that&#8217;s probs cos I&#8217;m on SOOOOOO many anti-sickness drugs it&#8217;s ridiculous!!  Am feeling sick though right now, when I have the 4 different chemo drugs all in a row it makes me feel sick&#8230;&amp; my tastebuds are changing which they also warned me about!  Seem to change throughout the day though, think depends what&#8217;s been drip, drip, dripping into me!  But yesterday OJ tasted like acid, a plain roll tasted like metal and pringles I&#8217;m sure were covered in iron filings!  In fact I can&#8217;t even type about food, my stomach&#8217;s turning&#8230;</p>
<p>So Friday night, Chris came fairly early so we had about an hour together alone which was lovely.  He brought me some cookies and cupcakes and they didn&#8217;t taste like metal!!  Phew!!  Then Anna arrived, followed by Ollie and Laura.  It was lovely to see all of them and I felt quite calm and relaxed.  We just chatted as normal really&#8230;.well remember normal now isn&#8217;t what normal used to be!  Anna got me some lovely pressies (Thank you!!) and even made me a Little Miss Scamp Mr Men card and made TEAM SCAMP wrapping paper!  Pink of course&#8230;very cool!  Ollie had set up my pretty new laptop and installed everything I needed.  She&#8217;s just so shiny!  Not sure why I&#8217;m referring to it as a person &#8211; Laura that&#8217;s your fault!!</p>
<p>Right I&#8217;m going to pipe down now, don&#8217;t feel too good,  It&#8217;s Sat morning and I feel sick and weak.  The ward&#8217;s practically empty now as most peeps gone home.  I have to move to the long stay ward around lunchtime.  The nurse asked me when the removal van is coming!  My dad asked the same!  They know me too well!  I don&#8217;t have THAT much stuff!</p>
<p>Today Anna&#8217;s coming back this morning and Chris is coming around lunchtime and Robin my bro is coming sometime (when he&#8217;s up!!)  My parents might come too but think they deserve a rest really!  Robin asked me on the phone the other day about the &#8216;viewing&#8217; times!!  Simple mistake &#8211; he of course meant visiting times but made me chuckle, sounds like a zoo!  I wish I WAS at the zoo&#8230;!xxx</p>
