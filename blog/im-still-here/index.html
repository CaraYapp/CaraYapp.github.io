		<p>&#8230;at home that is! (sorry to go on about it, but have to say touch wood!)  I&#8217;ve been having relatively &#8216;good&#8217; days&#8230;meaning I haven&#8217;t been sick (the state of the art new anti-sickness drug must&#8217;ve worked) and I&#8217;ve been able to eat and drink&#8230;usually on these days I&#8217;m unable to eat or drink or keep anything down and last time was on my way to hospital by now!  I could still go neutropenic at any point as the next week is when my blood count&#8217;s lowest and I&#8217;m at most risk so I have to take it easy and be careful of any potential germs and keep an eye on my temperature. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m still being well looked after by Goose and Chris between them and their handovers each morning and evening!! Bless them, they&#8217;re both doing an amazing job and I&#8217;m as useless as ever!  Progress though &#8211; today&#8217;s the first day I&#8217;ve made it out of my pj&#8217;s and into tracky bottoms and a t shirt!!  Wahoooooooo!  Now this doesn&#8217;t sound like much to you people with &#8216;lives&#8217; (life as in life as I use to know it!) but to me at the moment, it&#8217;s big news!  I&#8217;ve also managed most of the day on the sofa&#8230;and managed to concentrate long enough to watch a film&#8230;.again you&#8217;re probably thinking &#8216;what?!&#8217; but since my diagnosis I&#8217;ve really struggled to settle long enough to focus on watching films or reading books etc.  So it was only a rom com today but they&#8217;re my favourite and it was nice to escape from it all for a few hours!  I was talking to one of my nurses on the phone yesterday and we were saying out it&#8217;s hard to get a balance between reading &amp; thinking etc. about the cancer and having an escape from it with stuff that&#8217;s nothing to do with it.  I think that&#8217;s the hardest thing when I&#8217;m struggling is that my life as I knew it has just gone and I&#8217;m stuck with this evil cancer for the next year of my life (if I&#8217;m lucky) and it&#8217;s hard not to let it take over everything&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;anyway at the moment at least I&#8217;m still feeling much more positive.  It helps that I&#8217;m feeling better physically, although I am exhausted and am literally worn out after just getting up to do one thing.  You realise how much to take for granted, not even the big things, just the little things&#8230;EVERYTHING!  My mouth is blistering again so I&#8217;m trying to get as much food in while I still can before it gets really bad!!  &amp; my hands and feet are red raw again and really sore.  They blistered really badly from the last few times and entirely peeled&#8230;they haven&#8217;t finished healing from that yet and they&#8217;re off again!  So I&#8217;m not looking forward to that, but I just hope that if the chemo is powerful enough to do all these horrid things to the rest of my body that it&#8217;s doing what it&#8217;s supposed to to my tumour.  I have a scan on 20th July when I go back into Oxford that I&#8217;m told is the crucial one.  They&#8217;re looking for necrosis in the tumour which basically means holes in it.  It will determine the next steps for me in terms of treatment and surgery.  It&#8217;s bizarre being nervous about a scan that you can&#8217;t do anything about!  It&#8217;s not like an exam where I could revise for it or a lesson to teach that I could plan for!  I just have to try to stay positive and not worry and let the chemo work it&#8217;s magic&#8230;I hope&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;well sorry I haven&#8217;t been on here for a while and although it&#8217;s not all doom and gloom tonight I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s too much humour either!  It&#8217;s hard to retell stories of humour when you haven&#8217;t left the house!  Although I&#8217;m sure something will spring to mind when I have more energy&#8230;one of these days.  I&#8217;m getting sleepy now and my lovely Chris has made me my dinner&#8230;.mmmmmm food!  It&#8217;s such a novelty to be able to eat and enjoy it!  They told me in hospital they didn&#8217;t want me to lose anymore weight&#8230;well I&#8217;ve probably put it all back on this week with the amount I&#8217;ve been eating!&#8230;shame!  Oh well!</p>
<p>Night all xxx</p>
