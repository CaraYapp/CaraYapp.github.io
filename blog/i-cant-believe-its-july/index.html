		<p>Morning everyone!  I&#8217;m here again already and I bet you haven&#8217;t even read last night&#8217;s entry yet?!  Have you?  Well if not then you better had now!  Laura I hope your breakfast routine is back up and running &#8211; just in time for you coming home!</p>
<p>Well like the title says I&#8217;ve just realised it&#8217;s July and I just cannot believe it.  Literally since March when I found out I had a tumour and obviously particularly since April when I found out it was cancer I&#8217;ve just completely lost track of time!  So to me it still feels like it&#8217;s March or April&#8230;plus I&#8217;ve missed most of the lovely weather so I&#8217;m just not with it basically!  I can&#8217;t believe how soon school is breaking up and I&#8217;ve missed all that time it&#8217;s just bizarre. </p>
<p>Well I didn&#8217;t sleep very well at all last night and the chemo has started to kick in already.  I was told yesterday I&#8217;m losing too much weight and they don&#8217;t want me to lose anymore and might refer me to the dietician who will help me to add more calories!  I did say I&#8217;m quite happy to lose the weight but they prefer you to maintain a steady weight&#8230;for goodness sake it was the only benefit I was finding! (plus no waxing or shaving!)  But I guess it&#8217;s quite nice to be told to eat more calories&#8230;apart from at least 2 weeks out of each 3 I&#8217;m just not up to eating as I&#8217;m either being sick or feeling sick or both!  So obviously I will lose weight!!  Fine by me!</p>
<p>I have a dilemma this morning&#8230;basically when I arrived yesterday I was given my own room and then I had to move into a ward&#8230;.oooh I&#8217;ve just realised I told you this yesterday&#8230;so it&#8217;s been nice to be with the other ladies but now I&#8217;ve been offered another room again but I need to make my mind up this morning or I&#8217;ll lose it.  Part of me thinks I should stay in the ward to keep my spirits up etc. but part of me thinks that the people in here could change soon, probably tomorrow&#8230;and also if the chemo is taking it&#8217;s effects now then I&#8217;ll probably feel pretty ill pretty quickly and might just want my own space to sleep and rest.  HELP!!  Send me your words of wisdom and suggestions QUICKLY!!  NOW!!</p>
<p>Well I&#8217;ll finish off now but on a final note&#8230;I now miss Chris&#8217;s Darth Vader breathing as it&#8217;s nothing compared to the lady snoring that was going on last night in here!!  I love you baby and miss you lots and can&#8217;t wait to lie next to Darth Vader again! xxx</p>
<p>I hope everyone has a good day and don&#8217;t forget to comment or message me to keep me going!</p>
<p>Lots of love and hugs xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</p>
<p>P.S. Monday 6th July (this Monday) there&#8217;s a programme on Channel 4 about teenage bone cancer&#8230;sounds like there might be some similar stories to mine so it might be interesting to watch or record xxx</p>
