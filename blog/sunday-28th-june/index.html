		<p>Hello&#8230;I hope you&#8217;re all having a lovely weekend and enjoying the sunshine!  I can&#8217;t enjoy the sunshine anymore&#8230;I&#8217;ve turned from a sun worshipper to a sun hater!  Well&#8230;not a hater but it&#8217;s just too hot and I&#8217;m too wobbly and weak to enjoy it as it just makes me dizzy!  Plus I was told the chemo makes my skin much more sensitive so factor 50 it is for me!  No more tanning oil like the good old days!</p>
<p>Anyway I&#8217;ve tried to enjoy my weekend as best I can but my so called &#8216;good&#8217; days certainly aren&#8217;t as good this time&#8230;I manage to do less and less as each cycle goes by.  I just feel more tired and weaker and get exhausted so much more easily.  &amp; like I said I&#8217;m still a bit like bambi on ice so I can&#8217;t go too far being so wobbly! </p>
<p>Good news though we did manage to go and see our new house again on Friday evening!  Well, hopefully our new house&#8230;we&#8217;ve had an offer accepted and it is stunning.  We love it and it&#8217;s giving us something to focus on and be positive and look to the future for.  Saying that though I&#8217;m not sure how much use I&#8217;ll be when it comes to moving!!  Zero!  They&#8217;ll have to move me on the bed at this rate.  Maybe I can &#8216;direct&#8217; the moving of our belongings!</p>
<p>Yesterday I managed to go to my niece&#8217;s dance show at a summer fayre.  It was lovely spending some time with my family and getting to see her dance was fantastic and so adorable!  I had my fold up chair to sit on like some old granny!  &amp; with headscarf and sunglasses on my sister said I looked like a film star with a chauffer when I was sitting in my mum&#8217;s car!  My brother in law wasn&#8217;t so kind when he wanted me to earn a bit of cash setting up a fortune telling stand in the pub garden!  We managed to go for some tea afterwards and I managed not to cry all day until it was time to go home when I got a bit emotional!  It&#8217;s so frustrating feeling like this as even on the rare ocassion I can do &#8216;normal&#8217; things, I just don&#8217;t feel like &#8216;me&#8217; anymore so I can&#8217;t be myself.  I just don&#8217;t have the energy and I&#8217;m struggling too much with everything to be able to switch off and relax completely.  But anyway I think I just have to accept that this is a low time and I&#8217;m going to struggle and there won&#8217;t be many days that go by without tears&#8230;there certainly hasn&#8217;t been for a while.  But I&#8217;m desperately trying to focus on positives like how lucky I am to have such an amazing boyfriend and family and friends around me.  I know I keep saying that but it really is true.  I simply could not do this without them.  It&#8217;s hard enough with them!  But they&#8217;ve been truly amazing.  My mum and dad and Chris have spent so much time with me and so much time travelling to and from Oxford to be with me.  &amp; my mum has looked after me everyday at home while Chris has had to go to work as normal.  She&#8217;s been amazing to me and I&#8217;m so glad we&#8217;re so close and able to have such a strong relationship where she can be there for me in the way she is&#8230;.</p>
<p>Anyway I hope I&#8217;m not making anyone cry (my mum probably if she&#8217;s reading this!)  She&#8217;s had a day off from me today (very rare at the moment!)  Chris and I have had a quiet day together.  I don&#8217;t think I could have coped with anything more than that.  Especially after a few nights sleep of getting use to his &#8216;Darth Vader&#8217; breathing again!!  Hee hee, he doesn&#8217;t know I&#8217;m writing this!  He doesn&#8217;t snore, he just breathes like Darth Vader which at the moment seems to wake me at 5 a.m. and keep me awake so I crawl into the spare bed!!  Today we managed to walk into Fleet and have a Starbucks.  I know this doesn&#8217;t sound like much but it&#8217;s quite an achievement for me at the moment!  We had a look at some dream furniture for our dream house and did a few bits but I didn&#8217;t last long before I was too dizzy and wobbly and needed to come home.  I did manage to buy 4 more pairs of pyjamas in the La Senza sale though!  I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;ll do with all my pj&#8217;s when I&#8217;m better because I&#8217;ve got sooooooooooo many now!  I&#8217;ll have to have a pyjama sale!!  To be fair though I need lots of pretty pyjamas because I&#8217;m practically living in them.  I&#8217;ve had to rest for the rest of the day which is annoying as I&#8217;ll be doing enough of that when I&#8217;m back in hospital but I have to do what my body tells me to do and at the moment it&#8217;s definitely telling me to rest!</p>
<p>Well I&#8217;ll shut up now but I&#8217;m going to try to write on here more often now just to try to give myself a focus and keep myself sane&#8230;.so even if no-one&#8217;s reading it I&#8217;ll just keep writing!  But many of you are telling me you&#8217;re reading&#8230;in fact a lot more than I ever imagined and that&#8217;s inspires me to want to keep strong and keep going&#8230;although I&#8217;m struggling at the moment.  I don&#8217;t want to cut myself off so please do write a comment if you&#8217;re reading cos every comment, email, text, message, card I receive gives me a little push upwards and I need every tiny uplifting moment that I can grab onto at the moment&#8230;</p>
<p>Love you all xxx</p>
