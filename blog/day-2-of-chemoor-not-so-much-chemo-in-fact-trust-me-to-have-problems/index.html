		<p>Well I&#8217;ve done my first night&#8230;sound like I&#8217;m in prison!  It&#8217;s actually very nice here and I&#8217;m being taken care of very well.  Having all my stuff here is helping ALOT!  Quite nice at the moment in a very strange way, just listening to music, reading, watching movies, spending lots of money on ebay, oh DEAR!  Chris will be bombarded with parcels arriving at home, it&#8217;ll be like Christmas!!</p>
<p>Well last night turned out to be very complicated &#8230;yes even more complicated than I explained that it was planned to be!  Basically I finished my first 4 hour red drug (no pink pee, sorry to disappoint people!) then they flushed the drip through which was all fine but then within minutes or even seconds of drug number 2 going in, I reacted not too well!  Temperature shot up instantly and I was on fire, my eyes started to swell up, my breathing was really tight and went really dizzy and bit nauseous.  Sure you don&#8217;t want these details but oh well!  Tough!  I&#8217;m not leaving anything out, for this to lead to an international bestseller, it has to have gory details!  Although not too many of them&#8230;yet!</p>
<p>Anyway so they had to stop it for obvious reasons and within minutes I was fine again.  I must be allergic or something to something in that drug&#8230;.waiting for them to decide and let me know what the next step is.  Annoying as I&#8217;ll end up being like at least 12 hours behind my chemo schedule so I&#8217;ll probs be having to stay in til at least Sunday to get it all into me&#8230;that&#8217;s if my body can cope!</p>
<p>Anyway, it&#8217;s not all doom and gloom, I had breakfast in bed and just been choosing my lunch and dinner from a massive menu!  Food&#8217;s actually pretty good &#8211; I&#8217;m stocking my belly up now (not that I need to!) just in case I&#8217;m sick soon and won&#8217;t be able to eat.  Plus we all know food can cure anything!!</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all for now folks&#8230;Chris Moyles is keeping me sane at the moment on the radio!  Think I&#8217;ll get on twitter and try to be his friend!!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>They&#8217;ve just shown me there&#8217;s a bath!  How exciting!  I&#8217;m off to bathe and be clean and make the most of washing my hair while I still  can!</p>
<p>Adios amigos xxx</p>

					<p>Hiya,<br />
You did very well blogging!  How did you do it out of interest?  Not totally sure how other peeps do it, I just know how I do it if you know what I mean!  Peeps keep asking me!  They&#8217;re pretty relaxed here with visitors as long as people respect privacy and peace etc. as am sharing a &#8216;room&#8217; with 4 of us but it&#8217;s fine&#8230;so if you want to come tonight that&#8217;s cool but I will be in until at least Saturday, probs more likely Sunday or Monday now so there&#8217;s plenty of time &#8211; don&#8217;t want everyone coming now and no-one later, not that I&#8217;ll be abandoned I know!<br />
My canula&#8217;s in my right hand now so can&#8217;t type as well.  Just call me or text whenever, I&#8217;m here!!  I&#8217;ve got your phone charger here as I figure that&#8217;s when I&#8217;d next see you so I could give it back!  SOrry forgot on Sat!  Then was going to give to Katie on sun but forgot again!  Not surprising I guess with so much going on!</p>
<p>Mmmmmmmm chocolate!  THere&#8217;s a good shop here downstairs&#8230;xxx</p>
