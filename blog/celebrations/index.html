		<p>I think it&#8217;s a miracle that I&#8217;m writing this&#8230;.a) because it&#8217;s so soon after my last post compared to how long it&#8217;s been between each one recently b) because on Saturday night I knocked a whole entire glass of wine on my laptop &amp; it appeared to die instantly&#8230;miraculously it seems to be fine now! c) because normally today is the day, in the cycle that&#8217;s become normal for so long, that I would be back in hospital waiting for my chemo to start again&#8230;.so I think today it&#8217;s really starting to sink in that I don&#8217;t actually have to go back for more!</p>
<p>Anyway today&#8217;s blog will not be about my feelings as I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve heard enough about that for a while!  It&#8217;s just an update really&#8230;</p>
<p>On Saturday night I had the first celebration to celebrate me finishing chemo.  Lots of my friends &amp; family came to our local pub to eat, drink &amp; be merry with me!  &amp; very merry I was!  I had a lot of making up for lost time to do and goodness knows how I managed to keep going but lots of friends came back to our house after the pub and before I knew it, it was about 6.30 am!!  That&#8217;s when I eventually tried to go to bed&#8230;Chris had gone to bed not long before and was sparko!  I feel asleep eventually with Anna in one of the spare rooms sometime around 7 am and woke up at about 10 am practically falling out of the bed wondering where I was and where was BEAR!!  So I crawled (practically!) across the landing back to our bedroom and fell into bed with Chris &amp; Bear but couldn&#8217;t get back to sleep so that was that!  It was so lovely to celebrate with so many of the people who have been there for me through this time.  Of course not everybody could be there but I really appreciate the people who were and those who made a real effort to celebrate with us.  It makes you realise how hard it must be if you had a huge party though, or at your own wedding &#8211; having to try to talk to 100 people must be soooooo hard!  I found it hard enough with how ever many people were there on Saturday, which was quite a lot!  When I&#8217;m in a conversation I&#8217;m enjoying talking to that person and focusing on them, not thinking about moving on &amp; talking to someone else!  So I tried to work my way along the table early on and around the different groups of people later on.  Which pretty much worked and all my close friends totally understood anyway &amp; I talk to them all the time so they understood I needed to talk to people who I don&#8217;t see as often!  But then really I also wanted to celebrate with those who have been there for me 100% &#8230;anyway I had a great time and I hope everyone else did too!  There are photos on facebook for those of you who are on there!  I wish I&#8217;d taken more &amp; that my camera battery hadn&#8217;t run out <img src="../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":-(" class="wp-smiley" />  Oh well!  Plenty more fun times to come&#8230;</p>
<p>Today a photographer from one of the local newspapers is coming.  I&#8217;m determined to get my story heard and to raise awareness of bone cancer and sarcomas so I&#8217;m been pursuing lots of possible avenues.  It&#8217;s very early days and the only one to respond this quickly was the Yateley News &amp; Mail&#8230;it&#8217;s not much but it&#8217;s a start &amp; you have to start somewhere!  So I sent them my story in my own words and had a telephone interview with a journalist on Friday to give him more information.  He wants to run the story in this week&#8217;s paper so look out for it &amp; I&#8217;ll post on here when I know for sure that it&#8217;s coming out &amp; it&#8217;ll be in there!  I&#8217;m nervous about the photographer coming as I&#8217;m so tired and look so awful!  I also keep debating whether to have wig on or wig off&#8230;as I look nicer with wig on but wig off would be adding to the story more &amp; it&#8217;s all part of it&#8230;maybe he&#8217;ll take some of both &amp; we can decide afterwards depending on how many photos they want to use.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s me starting on my mission to raise awareness and hopefully before long I&#8217;ll make more things happen like women&#8217;s magazines, national newspapers and maybe even TV appearances.  &amp; hopefully one day for my book (when I&#8217;ve written it!) to be published.  The quest continues&#8230; if you can help in any way please get in touch!</p>
<p>Well I hope all my faithful readers are ok.  I better go now as I&#8217;m not even up yet and although there&#8217;s 2 hours before the photographer comes, I need to choose what to wear, put enough make up on to cover my tiredness, choose a wig &amp; get the house tidy!  I hope he doesn&#8217;t having me doing some strange poses or anything!  I&#8217;m scared!  This website and my link to sponsor Team Scamp (including me!) to do Race for Life this year (which by the way is <a href="http://www.raceforlifesponsorme.org/teamscamp2010">www.raceforlifesponsorme.org/teamscamp2010</a> if you would like to sponsor us &#8211; all funds raised go to Cancer Research UK&#8230;I haven&#8217;t sent the link out yet but be warned I will be pleading for sponsorship soon!)&#8230;will both be printed in the paper with my story so there might be some more bloggers joining us soon&#8230;watch this space!</p>
<p>Love to all xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</p>
