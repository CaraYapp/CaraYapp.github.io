		<p>I&#8217;m back!  Sorry it&#8217;s been so long again, I&#8217;ve been meaning to write for a while but here I am finally!  I&#8217;m now over the worst effects of my last chemo and this would usually be my &#8216;good&#8217; week when I&#8217;m up and about and doing more.  It&#8217;s hard to believe that it&#8217;s not just this week and that it will continue from now on.  I still don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s really sunk in that chemo&#8217;s over as it would normally be next Monday that I&#8217;d be going back in for my next chemo.  So it&#8217;ll be interesting to see how I&#8217;m feeling next week, I&#8217;ll feel like I&#8217;ve won the lottery having so much time out of hospital!  On that note, Chris and I have started entering the lottery as I figure if I&#8217;m on in however many million to have got Ewing&#8217;s Sarcoma, I must have good odds on winning the lottery!  If only it was that simple!</p>
<p>Well I had my usual days of rest where I barely made it out of bed and as you will have read in my last entry, I had many mixed and confusing feelings.  As with everything, those feelings have become less alien to me and become more &#8216;normal&#8217;  to me (I hate that word, what IS normal anyway?!!)    Yesterday I went to see a counsellor/psychologist at the Maggie&#8217;s Centre in Oxford, which is a centre on the hospital site which offers all kinds of support to cancer patients.  I figured I may as well go and speak to him as it could do no harm and having spoken to other patients who have seen him, they said it was helpful as he specialises in talking to cancer patients.  It was bizarre for me to be  going and I didn&#8217;t really know what to expect, having never done anything like that before and I suppose I never really thought I&#8217;d need to.  Anyone who knows me will know I can talk for England at the best of times and I have great family and friends who I always talk to.  Talking helps me and I never keep anything bottled up inside because, for me, talking about it always helps me.  So I thought, what&#8217;s the harm in talking to someone else about what&#8217;s been going on inside my head?!  I know there&#8217;s often a stigma attached to seeing a counsellor and a lot of people might not want people to know, but all it is at the end of the day, is talking, which I love so why keep that a secret?!!  Anyway it was really useful in the way that he assured me that all the things I&#8217;m feeling which seemed so strange to me, are perfectly &#8216;normal&#8217; in the circumstances and that everyone who goes to see him in similar circumstances, say all the same things to him.  He compared it alot to a grieving process when you lose someone, because something awful has happened to me and I&#8217;ve lost part of me (physically and emotionally!) and that it&#8217;s not that I need to come to terms with it, it&#8217;s just that I need to adjust to it and find my new place in the world.  I think that&#8217;s what I sometimes struggle with is that I was perfectly happy before and this came along and messed it all up and now I can never go back to how I was before, I have to adjust to how life will be from now on.  I know I HAVE to and I have no choice and the majority of the time I think I&#8217;m fine with that but then sometimes I can take myself my surprise and it&#8217;s as if the whole reality of it has hit me all over again&#8230;as if I&#8217;ve just been told again&#8230;and then I feel like I&#8217;m back to square one and I just don&#8217;t WANT to adjust to how things are post cancer&#8230;I want to go back to the old me and my old life, pre cancer.  But it&#8217;s tough luck basically and just a waste of time to think that!  He also hit the nail on the head, so to speak, by saying that I&#8217;ve lost any sense of immortality and any sense of taking anything for granted in life.  Of course, it&#8217;s a good thing not to take things for granted, particularly people, but I don&#8217;t think I ever did!  But it does do your head in when you can&#8217;t take ANYTHING for granted!  This is what I&#8217;ve been trying to say recently when talking to friends, that I feel like any innocence or naivety I had left in me has been taken away and I desperately want it back!  I feel like I can&#8217;t daydream about the future at all anymore because it&#8217;s all so uncertain.  I know it was before and that everyone&#8217;s future is uncertain but before I had no reason to think in that way and now I massively do!  Basically something very bad and very unexpected has happened to me and now I have no sense of &#8216;it won&#8217;t happen to me&#8217;&#8230;it&#8217;s not &#8216;why me?&#8217; anymore, it&#8217;s &#8216;why not me?&#8217;&#8230;I almost expect something awful to happen because I know it can.  Expect the unexpected I guess!  Hopefully that&#8217;ll work both ways and unexpected happy things will also happen.  Winning the lottery for us would be to be able to have our own children.  That&#8217;s another dream that&#8217;s been ruined, where as we used to always talk about &#8216;when we have our children&#8217; etc&#8230;.we still do have those conversations but they&#8217;re always followed by the black cloud that&#8217;s following us around that could jeapordise our chances of having a family and it&#8217;s no longer &#8216;when&#8217;, it&#8217;s &#8216;if&#8217;.</p>
<p>Anyway, on a happier note, in 5 weeks I will be on holiday!  It&#8217;s the first of our holidays.  It&#8217;s me &amp; Chris, my mum &amp; dad, my sister &amp; her husband &amp; 3 girls and my brother will come out for one week in the middle.  I can&#8217;t wait and am getting very excited but again, I&#8217;m scared to be excited in case anything ruins it!  &amp; it&#8217;s a long time since I felt true excitement so it feels strange!  &amp; there&#8217;s the guilt&#8230;I feel like I shouldn&#8217;t be going on holiday because I should be in hospital having chemo!  I know it sounds weird but it is what it is!  Anyway I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll get over it once I&#8217;m there!</p>
<p>At the weekend I went swimming for the first time.  I&#8217;ve been really looking forward to going since I got the Picc line out of my arm and it should be really good exercise for me and gentle on my leg too.  I was quite apprehensive about going because it would be the first time I&#8217;d have my scar on show and also I couldn&#8217;t very well go with my wig on so I&#8217;d have to bare my head in public too!  So anyway, I just wanted to do it because I knew if I went once, I&#8217;d be fine and I&#8217;d &#8216;get over it&#8217;!!!  So we went and I got in the water and then it suddenly dawned on me that I&#8217;d been so concerned about my hair and my scar that I hadn&#8217;t thought for one minute whether I&#8217;d actually be able to swim!  I said to Goose, &#8216;Oh, I don&#8217;t actually know what&#8217;s going to happen when I try to swim!&#8217;  so I tried breast stroke and my leg just was not doing what it was suppose to be doing!  I don&#8217;t know what on earth it was doing, but it wasn&#8217;t swimming!  It felt very bizarre and didn&#8217;t feel like my leg at all!  Obviously, since surgery I&#8217;ve never tried to do that movement because you don&#8217;t really do that in any other circumstance other than swimming!  So I opted for front crawl which obviously requires a much easier movement for your legs!   So I think I&#8217;m somehow going to have to learn to swim breast stroke with my &#8216;bionic&#8217; leg!  I guess that&#8217;s obvious really because I&#8217;ve had to learn to walk again so it makes sense that I&#8217;d have to learn to swim again!  It makes you realise how automatic all these things become and you don&#8217;t have to think about how you&#8217;re doing them at all&#8230;until something stops you from doing it!  It also made me realise that I don&#8217;t think anyone in that swimming pool&#8230;and I did choose the busiest time, Saturday afternoon&#8230;actually cared about my scar or my lack of hair!  Everyone&#8217;s too busy with what they&#8217;re doing to be bothered!  &amp; then I realised that it&#8217;s probably actually quite self obsessed (well, not obsessed but I can&#8217;t think of a better way of saying it right now!) to assume that people are going to be looking at me.  We all worry so much about people noticing things about us but in reality they&#8217;d have to be looking in the first place to notice, which they probably aren&#8217;t!  Plus the fact, none of those people know me, so they won&#8217;t have known me when I had long hair, no scar and was thinner, so they won&#8217;t be noticing any difference if they&#8217;d never seen me before!  Who cares anyway!  My hair is actually growing quite alot, I will post a photo on here soon to show you&#8230;</p>
<p>Anyway, a big thank you to everyone who&#8217;s got in touch with me since my last post and told me that you ARE reading and that I must keep writing!  I&#8217;ve been told!  Many people have emailed/facebooked/commented to let me know you&#8217;re reading, so thank you.   It means alot!  You may have noticed a recent comment on my last post from a lady talking about including me in a book.  It&#8217;s very exciting, an old friend suggested I befriend this lady on facebook.  She&#8217;s in California and is a cancer survivor herself.  She is wanting to put together a book called HOPE&#8230;to give people going through cancer hope by sharing inspirational stories of cancer survivors.  I have some similar books myself and for me, it really helps to read other people&#8217;s experiences as I can relate to so much of it and I find it really comforting.  I still think the most useful thing for me is to talk to, read about and meet other cancer patients.  It&#8217;s really comforting in a way I&#8217;ll never be able to describe.  Anyway so I wrote the brief version of my story on this lady&#8217;s facebook page and told her about this website and she&#8217;s interested!  So I&#8217;ll be very excited to pursue that.  I&#8217;m also going to write to some magazines to see if they&#8217;ll publish my story as I&#8217;m still really passionate about raising awareness of bone cancer as it&#8217;s so unheard of.  My ultimate dream would still be to have my book published (not that I&#8217;ve written in yet but this site gives me lots of material!)  So&#8230;if anyone knows anyone who works for a publisher, or a magazine&#8230;or anything you think might help me to raise awareness.  I REALLY want to go on This Morning and meet Holly Willoughby!  If anyone reading can in anyway help any of these things happen, please get in touch!!</p>
<p>Right, I&#8217;ve talked (typed!) enough for one day.  I will try to write more often and less each time, but I know I&#8217;ve said that before!  I will post pics of my hair growth soon!  I hope you&#8217;re all well&#8230;</p>
