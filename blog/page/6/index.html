		<p>Please follow this link to sponsor my brother Robin and my boyfriend Chris.  Quite a few other friends are interested in running it too  on &#8216;Team Scamp!&#8217; so you can just sponsor them collectively.  Please do though, even if it&#8217;s only a small donation, it will help.  I&#8217;m so proud of Robin and Chris for doing this for such a good cause in my honour.  I feel really passionately now about raising money for Cancer charities and although I can&#8217;t run from my hospital bed&#8230;or probably ever again&#8230;I can promote those who are doing it for me!!  &amp; I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s a million other things we could be doing &#8211; let me know your ideas, I&#8217;m happy to be promotions manager and chase sponsorships!!</p>
<p>Anyway go to <a href="http://www.justgiving/robinandchris">www.justgiving/robinandchris</a> and please donate kindly to something that&#8217;s so close to our hearts at the moment.</p>
<p>Much love</p>

		<p>I can&#8217;t type much as I&#8217;m usually speedy but the canula&#8217;s in my right wrist now so making it harder.  After the delays last night I&#8217;m back on track with chemo but am about 12 or 13 hrs behind schedule cos of it.  I&#8217;m on a non chemo drug at the mo which is just to protect my bladder as what I&#8217;m having is so powerful it could do some serious damage.  So on this for 18 hours!  So at least I shouldn&#8217;t be disturbed too much in the night.  Think it&#8217;s starting to take it&#8217;d toll as am starting to feel very tired and weary now.  This typing with canula driving me mad so I won&#8217;t be long! (remind me of that when I&#8217;ve rambled on until you&#8217;re about to fall asleep!  I&#8217;m good at that&#8230;might even send myself to sleep!!)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m feeling very lucky to have Chris and my family and friends as they&#8217;ve all been truly amazing.  Maybe not so lucky in other respects but I&#8217;m still being positive&#8230;just worried about when it might run out!!  Thank you so much for everything you&#8217;ve all done for me.  If there&#8217;s anything you take from this horrid experience, just make sure you look on the bright side of life!  I know it&#8217;s a cliche but life really is too short&#8230;I know it&#8217;s easier said than done but don&#8217;t take ANYTHING for granted&#8230;believe me I&#8217;ve moaned about my hair ALOT in the last 26 years (too long, too short, too this, too that, too dark, too blonde, too GREEN!  BUT let&#8217;s not talk about that!) but at least I had hair, now I&#8217;m just waiting for it to go, so tempting to shave it, can see why people do to avoid the upset and heartache.  But funnily enough I suddenly love my hair and think I was mental to ever moan!!  You don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;ve got til it&#8217;s gone&#8230;or waiting to go!!</p>
<p>Anyway my attitude has totally changed, although I&#8217;m apprehensive about trivial things like hair etc. I&#8217;m not worried because all I have to focus on is each day as it comes&#8230;and for all I care they can chop my leg off(but I hope not!) I just want to beat this thing and come out the other side.  I&#8217;ve got so much to live for and that&#8217;s all thanks to Chris, my family and friends so thank you!!</p>
<p>So enough of this sentimental rubbish, who else is visiting then?!  My friend Su (there you go Su &#8211; you&#8217;re officially famous now!) lives in Oxford so this is perfect for us catching up!  She&#8217;s popped in yesterday and today.  Gemma (Hewitt not Walton) &#8211; there you are, you got your mention&#8230;came in today too.  My mum and dad spent the afternoon here, looking at wig catalogues as if you&#8217;re just browsing a magazine as if it&#8217;s totally normal.  It&#8217;s amazing how fast your brain can adapt to what&#8217;s going on &#8211; I&#8217;ve only known 9 days it&#8217;s just crazy!  Think Gemma (Walton), Chris O and Dave might be coming tomorrow?  Then Anna and maybe Ollie and Laura on Friday?  Then my bro Robin and maybe Anna again on Saturday, depends when I&#8217;ll get released&#8230;maybe I&#8217;ll be let out early for good behaviour?!  I&#8217;ve already got a reputation on the ward for loving pink as my bed is surrounded!  &amp; for talking to everyone!  See &#8211; cancer may be nasty but it can&#8217;t stop me talking!&#8230;or eating&#8230;.or laughing!  I&#8217;m still me!  At least for now&#8230;</p>
<p>Anyway I&#8217;m off, this canula is going to drive me mad&#8230;having a permanant line put in next time so I&#8217;ll even have it when I&#8217;m at home, but NOOOOOOO before anyone asks, that doesn&#8217;t mean you can connect me to a drip full of Magners, or Rose!  Anyway I&#8217;d rather taste it!!</p>
<p>Still no pink pee, the stuff I&#8217;m on now is clear.  Not sure why I want to tell the world about my pee but hey ho!  I&#8217;ve lost all dignity already so no worries about sharing pee stories&#8230;.in case you wanted to know, EVERY time I go I have to go in a cardboard thing and write my bed number on it so it can be checked!!  Nice!  I don&#8217;t think I can cling on to this comparison with me to Carrie from Sex and the City&#8230;don&#8217;t remember her ever peeing into a cardboard &#8216;wee bowl&#8217;!!  I&#8217;ve got the box set at home, plenty of time for me to check!</p>
<p>Right think I&#8217;ll get some sleep now, the &#8216;snorer&#8217; (who will remain anonymous!) in the bed next to me left today so hopefully I&#8217;ll sleep better!  She does have a replacement though so we&#8217;ll see if she snores too!!  Apparently I talk in my sleep (says Chris!  &amp; my family from when I was younger!) so god knows what I&#8217;ll be saying- I&#8217;ll give away all my secrets!(not that I have any, I can&#8217;t shut up long enough to keep them!!  Well not my own anyway!)</p>
<p>Well just like my talking, my typing goes ooooooooon and ooooooooon and ooooooooon too!  Even when I  said I won&#8217;t type much cos of canula.  I really am tired now so think I&#8217;ll try to sleep.  I&#8217;m supposed to be at a McFly concert now with Laura but obviously I couldn&#8217;t go so Ollie&#8217;s gone instead.  They keep calling bless them to play songs as I requested but I cannot here a THING just really really loud noise and no songs!!  At least I have it on my ipod though, YAY!</p>
<p>Night night everyone.  I hope some of you manage to do some work whilst reading this in between!</p>
<p>Remember, just be happy with what you&#8217;ve got and if you&#8217;re not, change it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m so lucky for this to have happened to me at this time when Chris and I couldn&#8217;t be more happy and secure and I&#8217;ve got my friends and family around me.  Make the most of what you&#8217;ve got cos one day you might regret it if you lose some of it temporarily!  I have no regrets as I feel I&#8217;ve always done what I&#8217;ve wanted to do and followed my heart&#8230;if I hadn&#8217;t I thnk I&#8217;d be going a bit crazy by now with all this time to think you&#8217;re bound to start thinking &#8216;what if&#8230;&#8217; but I feel strangely content considering the circumstances.  I just have to let the experts (who have all been amazingly lovely and helpful.  They call themselves Team Cara!!) do what they&#8217;ve got to do and try to relax as best I can.  Yes they are poisoning me in effect but it&#8217;s to make me better and it WILL make me better.  It&#8217;s just hitting home how LONG it&#8217;s going to be, the day itself has gone surprisingly quickly but I can&#8217;t believe in the grand scheme of things how early on it is and how much worse it&#8217;s going to get&#8230;.but like I said, one day at a time and I<strong> WILL</strong> get there.</p>
<p>Sleep well everyone and I&#8217;ll hope for some more comments tomorrow&#8230;I&#8217;m loving this!  Remember, anything&#8217;s possible &#8211; if I can get this evil thing then I can also become an author!  Move over Marian Keyes!  Actually think it&#8217;d be more like Bridget Jones meets Jade Goody&#8230;but with a <strong>HAPPY ENDING!!</strong></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t have petty arguments, don&#8217;t sleep on an argument and make the best of what you&#8217;ve got.  We are all lucky in ways and unlucky in others.  If I had no support or Chris or friends or family then I&#8217;d be a hell of a lot worse than this so just appreciate who you&#8217;ve got.  I know you all do anyway but it&#8217;s so easy to take things and people for granted and to obsess or stress or worry about trivial things.  I know you won&#8217;t all change your thinking overnight but I feel like I have.  I know the people who care about me will love me no matter what, hair or no hair, fat or thin (I&#8217;m hoping to get down to 7 stone on chemo!  I hear it can be done!)  Although at the mo I&#8217;m eating like a horse to stock up in case I get sick soon!  The food here&#8217;s really nice!  Think I&#8217;m the annoying new kid on the block as I&#8217;m stuffing my face and loving it, everyone else is moaning.  Just proves I&#8217;m easily pleased!!  Some of them are alot further on with treatment so are off their food, so I&#8217;ve got that to look forward to?!  But apparently I&#8217;m having more chemo and for longer than them.  Lots of them haven&#8217;t lost their hair, but with my chemo combination of drugs, I will.</p>
<p>Anyway the point I was trying to make was that so many things we stress about really really really just do not MATTER!  Just ask yourself  &#8216;does it matter?!&#8217;  The answer&#8217;s probably no!  Obviously putting things into perspective also has to be realistic, we can&#8217;t ignore all the trivial things or we wouldn&#8217;t be human!  I&#8217;ve just forgotten so quickly what it&#8217;s like to worry about the day to day things like planning a lesson for school or getting all my marking done or the housework or what I look like etc. etc.  My attitude now is if I&#8217;m alive it&#8217;s good enough&#8230; I know it sounds stupid but it&#8217;s true!  Having no hair, having a knee replacement, all these things that seemed like the end of the world, really don&#8217;t anymore.  Because the end of the world will not happen as long as I&#8217;m still here and I just know I&#8217;ll grow to be an oooooooold laaaaaaaaadyyyyyyy!!</p>
<p>Oh dear, this is starting to sound like a self-help book now and that&#8217;s really NOT what I was aiming for!&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8216;How to bore your friends and family to insanity in 1 easy step: go all sentimental on them and start spurting out stereotypical advice which will make them want to puke!&#8217;</p>

<p>If any publishers or magazine editors are reading this, I promise if you sign me up I won&#8217;t go down that path again&#8230;much!</p>
<p>Just a simple bye will do now cos I can&#8217;t shut up!  I might post on here what I wrote at home the first night I found out about this&#8230;if I&#8217;m feeling brave.  I haven&#8217;t read it since that night and god knows what it said!  Feels like I&#8217;ve been drunk or dreaming for the last 9 days and I&#8217;ll soon wake up with a hangover&#8230;no such luck!!  &amp; I haven&#8217;t been drinking&#8230;honestly!!</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve now had the 2nd drug which I reacted to.  They gave me hydrochlortisone and piriton in my canula first to minimise allergies and then gave it to me at a slower rate so it took twice as long.  I&#8217;ve now just started the first 1 and a half hours of 2 that I was supposed to have at midnight last night!  So very behind!  So I&#8217;ll probs be here til at least Sat, probs Sun or Mon, will have to move to long stay ward but it&#8217;s only just through a door.  It&#8217;s lovely here, there&#8217;s even a roof garden, shame I&#8217;m not allowed to sunbathe!</p>

		<p>Well I&#8217;ve done my first night&#8230;sound like I&#8217;m in prison!  It&#8217;s actually very nice here and I&#8217;m being taken care of very well.  Having all my stuff here is helping ALOT!  Quite nice at the moment in a very strange way, just listening to music, reading, watching movies, spending lots of money on ebay, oh DEAR!  Chris will be bombarded with parcels arriving at home, it&#8217;ll be like Christmas!!</p>
<p>Well last night turned out to be very complicated &#8230;yes even more complicated than I explained that it was planned to be!  Basically I finished my first 4 hour red drug (no pink pee, sorry to disappoint people!) then they flushed the drip through which was all fine but then within minutes or even seconds of drug number 2 going in, I reacted not too well!  Temperature shot up instantly and I was on fire, my eyes started to swell up, my breathing was really tight and went really dizzy and bit nauseous.  Sure you don&#8217;t want these details but oh well!  Tough!  I&#8217;m not leaving anything out, for this to lead to an international bestseller, it has to have gory details!  Although not too many of them&#8230;yet!</p>
<p>Anyway so they had to stop it for obvious reasons and within minutes I was fine again.  I must be allergic or something to something in that drug&#8230;.waiting for them to decide and let me know what the next step is.  Annoying as I&#8217;ll end up being like at least 12 hours behind my chemo schedule so I&#8217;ll probs be having to stay in til at least Sunday to get it all into me&#8230;that&#8217;s if my body can cope!</p>
<p>Anyway, it&#8217;s not all doom and gloom, I had breakfast in bed and just been choosing my lunch and dinner from a massive menu!  Food&#8217;s actually pretty good &#8211; I&#8217;m stocking my belly up now (not that I need to!) just in case I&#8217;m sick soon and won&#8217;t be able to eat.  Plus we all know food can cure anything!!</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all for now folks&#8230;Chris Moyles is keeping me sane at the moment on the radio!  Think I&#8217;ll get on twitter and try to be his friend!!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>They&#8217;ve just shown me there&#8217;s a bath!  How exciting!  I&#8217;m off to bathe and be clean and make the most of washing my hair while I still  can!</p>

		<p>Hey guys!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m just writing a quick message as I&#8217;m still getting use to the chemo going into my head so trickier to type than usual.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a very long day, lots more tests and waiting so chemo didn&#8217;t start til about 7.  I should be out by Saturday afternoon but it may be longer.  I&#8217;ve nearly finished my first 4 hour stint of one drug, then in 10 mins it has to be changed for an hour of another, then 2 x hour and a half sessions of 2 hours.  My chemo is a pretty complex mix of drugs, mmmmm cocktails!!  This one I&#8217;m on at the mo is a reddy colour and they said I might pee pink&#8230;no such luck yet!  It&#8217;s lucky I&#8217;m easily pleased, pink pee would make everything so much better!</p>
<p>Chris managed to sort out the internet for me so I will be online checking emails, facebook and of course the soon to be world famous <a href="../../../">www.carayapp.com</a> !!  Thank you Ollie, I can&#8217;t thank you enough.  Soon I&#8217;ll be tapping away on a pink laptop which will make all the difference (remember easily pleased!)</p>
<p>Chris, my mum and dad left me about an hour ago.  They&#8217;re pretty relaxed here about visitors so I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll see some of you soon.  I am just shattered though but don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll be sleeping much tonight with all these changes!  Looking forward to getting into the swing of this site, I feel like Carrie from Sex and the City, although not quite so attractive, sitting in my pj&#8217;s with a drip into my hand, waiting for my hair to fall out!  More like NO Sex and the City!!!</p>
<p>For those of you who don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;m in the new cancer unit at the Churchill hospital in Oxford.  I there because what I have is a very rare form of bone cancer and this is where the specialists are.  I will post more tomorrow and probably start from the beginning of my story.  If any publishers happen to read this, I am interested in writing a book, in fact I&#8217;ve already started! (seriously)</p>
<p>Well good night to everyone, write back, email, text, call, visit, whatever you like!  Just don&#8217;t bring flowers as not allowed them apparently!  Can have them when home though&#8230;.there&#8217;s always chocolate (until I start to feel sick, no sign yet though!)&#8230;teddy bears, books, games, magazines, expensive champagne, cream convertible beetles, st bernard puppies&#8230;I hear all these things cure the cancer I&#8217;ve got!!</p>
<p>Looking forward to chatting to you all</p>
<p>Lots of love</p>
<p>Cara (Scamp) xxx</p>
