		<p>Well most of you will probably know by now that I ended up back in hospital on Thursday.  I was coming in to have my blood count checked as a precaution anyway as that&#8217;s usually the time things start to go wrong and we needed to be safe this time after ending up in intensive care last time.  Then I woke up on Thursday with a sore throat and my mouth had got a lot worse so when we told the Professor this he said to admit me immediately cos we can&#8217;t take any chances this time.  Then it turned out from checking my blood count that I definitely needed to be here anyway!  I was (still am!) neutropenic and also anaemic again.  I needed a 3 unit blood transfusion this time and platelets and to start antibiotics and fluids again.  So&#8230;here I am again!  I haven&#8217;t had much sleep since I&#8217;ve got here as it&#8217;s a constant flow of nurses needing to do this that and the other!  It&#8217;s now my birthday and I&#8217;ve been awake since 5 am&#8230;it&#8217;s so annoying being woken that early when you&#8217;ve got a day of sitting in your room ahead of you!  Oh well, I&#8217;m obviously disappointed to be here on my birthday but I did expect it and I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;ll be a lovely day and my visitors will make it special for me.  &amp; then I&#8217;m hoping to get home for a few days again next week before going back for chemo so hopefully I can have a 2nd birthday!  Anna and I did decide though that as this year of my life has been stolen from me that I shouldn&#8217;t have to age a year!  So does that mean I&#8217;m not 27 today, I&#8217;m only 26?!  Or maybe I could go back to 21?!  I really don&#8217;t like the number 27, it&#8217;s bugging me and I don&#8217;t want to change my age at the top of this web page!  I&#8217;m sure that can wait until tomorrow at least!  I&#8217;m still 26 until 7pm tonight when I was born!</p>
<p>Right well I&#8217;m being bugged by nurses again so I&#8217;m off!  Chris should be here soon&#8230;he&#8217;s coming in early today to see the birthday girl!(that&#8217;s me!)</p>
<p>Lots of love xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m home again&#8230;got home yesterday afternoon and I&#8217;m feeling ok but just totally wiped out from it all this time, am absolutely shattered and exhausted.  I&#8217;m just really hoping that I&#8217;ll manage to stay at home until Saturday as it&#8217;s my birthday!  I&#8217;m not holding out much hope though as usually at that point in my cycle I&#8217;ve always been back in hospital so I figure if I expect it this time I can&#8217;t be disappointed!  It&#8217;s only a day anyway, in the grand scheme of things it doesn&#8217;t really matter&#8230;I am upset I&#8217;ll have to change my age at the top of this website to 27 though!  I&#8217;m really not liking the sound of that!</p>

		<p>Well I won&#8217;t beat around the bush(!)&#8230;the good news is&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;I had the mri scan yesterday and was quickly visited by Prof who told me that the tumour seems to be responding to the chemo as it&#8217;s showing signs of necrosis which is what they were hoping to see&#8230;wahoooooooooooo!!  YAY!!  So that was FINALLY a bit of good news in the midst of all this rubbish.  So basically what that means for me is that they&#8217;ll carry on as planned &#8211; so 2 more chemos then a little break and then surgery, probably early September.   The dates will get sorted out soon.  Then the chemo after surgery depends on what they find when they remove it etc.</p>
<p>So, chemo  starts again today (number 5) which I&#8217;m obviously not looking forward to but am in quite a positive frame of mind at the moment anyway and obviously the news yesterday has helped with that too!  I also managed to have a lovely weekend.  I got home Friday early evening and had until Monday morning at home.  Not long at all but long enough to catch up with lots of people and eat lots and make the most of my time at home!  Sleeping in my own bed was amazing but I did have a freaky experience Friday night when I woke up in the middle of the night convinced that I was still in my hospital bed and wondering why there was an arm lying next to me in my bed!  In my half asleep state I honestly thought I was in my tiny hospital bed with just an arm lying next to me&#8230;horror film style!!  Of course I then eventually realised (after poking and prodding the arm to check that it was in face an arm!) that the arm was attached to Chris who was lying next to me none the wiser, fast asleep!  It freaked me out alot for those few minutes before I realised!  I&#8217;m still blonde!!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also had some sad news too though&#8230;the lady who I met in here and who helped me so much with her positive cheerful attitude last time when I shared a ward with her, has passed away <img src="../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":-(" class="wp-smiley" />  I&#8217;ve just found out this morning.  She was only 39 and such a lovely person.  Life just isn&#8217;t fair and cancer is so evil.</p>
<p>Well I hope you&#8217;re all still reading and haven&#8217;t given up on carayapp.com!  I keep getting people telling me they check everyday and they&#8217;re missing it!  Sorry!  I shall endeavour to write on here more&#8230;although I&#8217;m not sure how much I&#8217;ll have to tell you as I&#8217;m in for another week of&#8230;not much!  I&#8217;ll try my best though!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll leave you with a little pearl of wisdom from the front of a card Lou gave me which is genius!&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;&#8221;A spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down! But I prefer chocolate&#8221; by Molly, age 5.  I agree with Molly age 5!!! xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Well I last wrote on here on Wednesday and everything was going pretty well&#8230;how things changed!  To cut a long story short I ended up feeling pretty rough on Thursday with a sore throat and feeling very faint and dizzy.  My hands and feet were worse and my mouth really bad.  It&#8217;s hard to know when to do something about it and in hindsight maybe we should&#8217;ve got me into hospital earlier but by the evening I was so tired I just wanted to sleep!  Goose was worried so had stayed while I&#8217;d fallen asleep (with Chris doing his Darth Vader impression very well!!)  then I woke up at 2 am and my throat had got alot worse and my temperature had shot up which is the warning sign of infection and having gone neutropenic so I had to go to A&amp;E yet again&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;by this point I was feeling really poorly and in A&amp;E was trembling and shaking and freezing but with a really high fever by now.  It was the usual nightmare in A&amp;E&#8230;they didn&#8217;t want to use the PICC line that I&#8217;ve got in my arm so they were trying to get veins to put in a canula but couldn&#8217;t get a vein&#8230;but still attempted over and over and over again stabbing me in every possible place!  Anyway I said this would be the short version&#8230;eventually they used the PICC line and took blood and got me on antibiotics&#8230;then decided I needed to go to intensive care and that they were going to put an arterial line in my wrist AND a central line into a vein in my neck.  I really didn&#8217;t like the sound of this but the very tall doctor was a bit like the BFG so I thought I&#8217;d trust him!  &amp; he assured me that it wouldn&#8217;t hurt and that once it was in people forget they&#8217;re there!  Well&#8230;the BFG lied!  I had to go up to recovery to have these things put in&#8230;the wrist one was bad enough but bearable&#8230;the neck line was not&#8230;it was unbearable.  I had to lie down with an oxygen mask on and a sterile drape over my face while the doctor poked and prodded and my god I was as close to hysterical as I have been!   I wasn&#8217;t allowed anyone in with me so this poor student nurse was put in charge of keeping me calm&#8230;hmmm poor girl!  I just could not stop crying and was shaking like mad and freezing cold but wasn&#8217;t allowed a blanket cos my temperature was so high!  He injected local anaesthetic into my neck which was painful enough in itself but then I could still feeling him poking around in there.  GROSS!  Anyway the stupid line is still in my neck now and is sooooo painful and uncomfortable it&#8217;s driving me insane.  I&#8217;m waiting for the doctors to come round today in the hope that they&#8217;ll say it can come out now.  To top that as well as soon as they&#8217;d finished putting the line in my neck which took a long time, the nurse springs on me that she&#8217;s going to put a catheter in.  The less said about the better I think!  Not pleasant at all though and I&#8217;m very glad that came out when I left intensive care.  Very weird though and quite fascinating that I didn&#8217;t even know when I was peeing!  Chris was very interested at looking at the bag and letting me know when I was peeing!  Remember there&#8217;s not much to do in an intensive care room!</p>
<p>I was in intensive care until Saturday evening.  It was not an enjoyable experience obviously but I improved very quickly after on Friday having lots of fluid, lots of drugs, 4 units of blood and 2 units of platelets pumped into me!  I&#8217;m glad now to be back on the parkside ward that I&#8217;ve ended up in the last 2 times.  If I have to be anywhere I&#8217;d choose here so I&#8217;m trying to remain positive.  I feel alot better in myself so am just trying to relax and be patient (something I&#8217;ve had to be the past 3 months!)  At the moment my priority is just to get this thing out of my neck!  &amp; hopefully I&#8217;ll be out in time to have a good few days at home before I&#8217;m back to Oxford next Monday 20th.  I should think I&#8217;ll leave here Wednesday at the earliest but I&#8217;ve been given no indication of that yet either.</p>
<p>&#8230;so for now it&#8217;s just days in hospital with magazines, colouring and playing Uno again!  Keep the messages coming to keep me busy!</p>
<p>Bye for now x</p>
<p>P.S. Thank you Bear (IT manager) for sorting out the spam filter.  There&#8217;s no random comments now, thank you it&#8217;s SO much better! x</p>

		<p>&#8230;at home that is! (sorry to go on about it, but have to say touch wood!)  I&#8217;ve been having relatively &#8216;good&#8217; days&#8230;meaning I haven&#8217;t been sick (the state of the art new anti-sickness drug must&#8217;ve worked) and I&#8217;ve been able to eat and drink&#8230;usually on these days I&#8217;m unable to eat or drink or keep anything down and last time was on my way to hospital by now!  I could still go neutropenic at any point as the next week is when my blood count&#8217;s lowest and I&#8217;m at most risk so I have to take it easy and be careful of any potential germs and keep an eye on my temperature. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m still being well looked after by Goose and Chris between them and their handovers each morning and evening!! Bless them, they&#8217;re both doing an amazing job and I&#8217;m as useless as ever!  Progress though &#8211; today&#8217;s the first day I&#8217;ve made it out of my pj&#8217;s and into tracky bottoms and a t shirt!!  Wahoooooooo!  Now this doesn&#8217;t sound like much to you people with &#8216;lives&#8217; (life as in life as I use to know it!) but to me at the moment, it&#8217;s big news!  I&#8217;ve also managed most of the day on the sofa&#8230;and managed to concentrate long enough to watch a film&#8230;.again you&#8217;re probably thinking &#8216;what?!&#8217; but since my diagnosis I&#8217;ve really struggled to settle long enough to focus on watching films or reading books etc.  So it was only a rom com today but they&#8217;re my favourite and it was nice to escape from it all for a few hours!  I was talking to one of my nurses on the phone yesterday and we were saying out it&#8217;s hard to get a balance between reading &amp; thinking etc. about the cancer and having an escape from it with stuff that&#8217;s nothing to do with it.  I think that&#8217;s the hardest thing when I&#8217;m struggling is that my life as I knew it has just gone and I&#8217;m stuck with this evil cancer for the next year of my life (if I&#8217;m lucky) and it&#8217;s hard not to let it take over everything&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;anyway at the moment at least I&#8217;m still feeling much more positive.  It helps that I&#8217;m feeling better physically, although I am exhausted and am literally worn out after just getting up to do one thing.  You realise how much to take for granted, not even the big things, just the little things&#8230;EVERYTHING!  My mouth is blistering again so I&#8217;m trying to get as much food in while I still can before it gets really bad!!  &amp; my hands and feet are red raw again and really sore.  They blistered really badly from the last few times and entirely peeled&#8230;they haven&#8217;t finished healing from that yet and they&#8217;re off again!  So I&#8217;m not looking forward to that, but I just hope that if the chemo is powerful enough to do all these horrid things to the rest of my body that it&#8217;s doing what it&#8217;s supposed to to my tumour.  I have a scan on 20th July when I go back into Oxford that I&#8217;m told is the crucial one.  They&#8217;re looking for necrosis in the tumour which basically means holes in it.  It will determine the next steps for me in terms of treatment and surgery.  It&#8217;s bizarre being nervous about a scan that you can&#8217;t do anything about!  It&#8217;s not like an exam where I could revise for it or a lesson to teach that I could plan for!  I just have to try to stay positive and not worry and let the chemo work it&#8217;s magic&#8230;I hope&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;well sorry I haven&#8217;t been on here for a while and although it&#8217;s not all doom and gloom tonight I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s too much humour either!  It&#8217;s hard to retell stories of humour when you haven&#8217;t left the house!  Although I&#8217;m sure something will spring to mind when I have more energy&#8230;one of these days.  I&#8217;m getting sleepy now and my lovely Chris has made me my dinner&#8230;.mmmmmm food!  It&#8217;s such a novelty to be able to eat and enjoy it!  They told me in hospital they didn&#8217;t want me to lose anymore weight&#8230;well I&#8217;ve probably put it all back on this week with the amount I&#8217;ve been eating!&#8230;shame!  Oh well!</p>

		<p>Hi all,</p>
<h5>Really not going to write much as haven&#8217;t had much sleep and although I don&#8217;t feel too tired, tonight I shall be woken at midnight, 1.30, 5.30. 7, 8.30 or there abouts so I won&#8217;t get too much sleep so I&#8217;d better start trying soon!</h5>
<p>I&#8217;ve had another &#8216;good&#8217;  day, no tears, still managing to eat and no sickness&#8230;touch wood!!  I&#8217;m so scared of cursing it.  We&#8217;re now addicted to playing Uno, does anyone know it?  We love it, Chris is very competitive and likes to win!  Goose (my mum) is getting that way too!</p>
<p>Today I&#8217;ve spent some lovely time with Goose out on the roof garden (in the shade of course!) Then Chris arrived earlier as managed to get away from work in Wales a bit earlier which was lovely&#8230;he brought in a lovely picture of us in a frame from home from when we were on holiday in Portugal last summer so that made me smile too and the other ladies here and the nurses have just been admiring it!!  &amp; my long blonde hair in it that I was probably stressing about looking horrible at the time looks perfectly LOVELY to me now!!</p>
<p>Anyway then my dad came for a bit too and tonight Mr and Mrs Bear AKA Ollie and Laura have been to see me.  They brought subways but I&#8217;m not really allowed them but so I missed out <img src="../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":-(" class="wp-smiley" /> but at least I know Chris has been fed tonight&#8230;I do worry!  Anyway so we&#8217;ve been sitting out on the roof garden too which has been lovely&#8230;a really nice warm but cool summer&#8217;s evening &#8211; we were saying we needed to set up a few disposable barbies (BBQs not barbie dolls!) out there!  Anyway it was really really lovely to see them as it&#8217;s been a long time.  Apart from them both looking very brown as they&#8217;ve just got back from holiday&#8230;especially Laura &#8211; I warned her I&#8217;d scratch her eyes out if she was too brown but she didn&#8217;t listen!  I managed to resist as it was too lovely to see her to start beating her up!!</p>
<p>Well I&#8217;m signing off now&#8230;until tomorrow (today for probably most of you reading this!)  I spend alot of the day online at the moment so if anyone&#8217;s bored at work (or at home) come onto facebook to chat or email me!! &amp; keep the comments coming, I love reading them!!</p>
<p>Big hugs and sloppy kisses!!</p>

		<p>Good evening!  Well like the title says it&#8217;s Wednesday evening now&#8230;by now I&#8217;m usually curled up in a ball sleeping, not talking (seriously &#8211; me not talking!), not eating and being sick.  This time I&#8217;ve been chatting (yes back to being me!) and eating like a horse (not a gift horse or a hungry horse or any of those silly sayings!) and not been or felt sick at all&#8230;TOUCH WOOD&#8230; I really don&#8217;t want to curse this as after another sleepless night with 4 different chemos going in it could be a very different story on the sickness front tomorrow&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;I&#8217;m really glad I stayed on this ward today and didn&#8217;t go into my own room cos the day&#8217;s gone really quickly with other people around.  &amp; I&#8217;ve been keeping myself busy chatting online and emailing and I&#8217;ve taken to colouring now!  I find it really therapeutic and addictive so it&#8217;s working for me at the moment &amp; anything that works is worth a try!  I&#8217;ve reverted to being a child (some of you may think that hasn&#8217;t been much of a transformation!) with my new colouring books and pencils and taking my bear everywhere!  I will post a photo of my bear on here soon as he started off naked as bears often are!  He&#8217;s now got a Team Scamp t-shirt on (it&#8217;s an early baby one!  Anna made it for him bless her!  Thanks scampi!!)  Anna will have so much to read and catch up on when she gets back as she&#8217;s away for 2 weeks at the moment and I&#8217;m missing her lots but texting lots!  Anyway so today was another good day and has gone really quickly.  My mum&#8217;s been with me during the day as always which is always lovely company.  Chris came this evening after working in Wales bless him and Gemma W and Chris O came to see me too which was lovely as I haven&#8217;t seen them for ages.  I haven&#8217;t seen lots of people for ages cos I haven&#8217;t been up to it for so long but I&#8217;m feeling better now than I have for a long time&#8230;let&#8217;s hope I&#8217;m not jinxing it by going on about it!</p>
<p>Thank you for all your comments those of you who wrote them and everyone who&#8217;s let me know you&#8217;re reading&#8230;sounds like there&#8217;s a fair few addicts out there!  What will you do when I&#8217;m better?!  I&#8217;m not looking forward to tonight as it&#8217;s all the drug changes again all through the night so I won&#8217;t get much sleep again and I&#8217;m just not feeling tired for the first time in weeks if not months, I actually feel quite hyper!  It must be all the food&#8230;.my doctor told me today to eat as much junk as I can!!  OK!!  It&#8217;s jaffa cakes I&#8217;m addicted to at the moment!  &amp; pasta!  Funny how things change all the time&#8230;</p>
<p>Anyway night night I hope I&#8217;ll be back tomorrow&#8230;if not you&#8217;ll know I&#8217;ve deteriorated overnight&#8230;here&#8217;s hoping NOT!</p>
<p>Love and hugs</p>

		<p>Morning everyone!  I&#8217;m here again already and I bet you haven&#8217;t even read last night&#8217;s entry yet?!  Have you?  Well if not then you better had now!  Laura I hope your breakfast routine is back up and running &#8211; just in time for you coming home!</p>
<p>Well like the title says I&#8217;ve just realised it&#8217;s July and I just cannot believe it.  Literally since March when I found out I had a tumour and obviously particularly since April when I found out it was cancer I&#8217;ve just completely lost track of time!  So to me it still feels like it&#8217;s March or April&#8230;plus I&#8217;ve missed most of the lovely weather so I&#8217;m just not with it basically!  I can&#8217;t believe how soon school is breaking up and I&#8217;ve missed all that time it&#8217;s just bizarre. </p>
<p>Well I didn&#8217;t sleep very well at all last night and the chemo has started to kick in already.  I was told yesterday I&#8217;m losing too much weight and they don&#8217;t want me to lose anymore and might refer me to the dietician who will help me to add more calories!  I did say I&#8217;m quite happy to lose the weight but they prefer you to maintain a steady weight&#8230;for goodness sake it was the only benefit I was finding! (plus no waxing or shaving!)  But I guess it&#8217;s quite nice to be told to eat more calories&#8230;apart from at least 2 weeks out of each 3 I&#8217;m just not up to eating as I&#8217;m either being sick or feeling sick or both!  So obviously I will lose weight!!  Fine by me!</p>
<p>I have a dilemma this morning&#8230;basically when I arrived yesterday I was given my own room and then I had to move into a ward&#8230;.oooh I&#8217;ve just realised I told you this yesterday&#8230;so it&#8217;s been nice to be with the other ladies but now I&#8217;ve been offered another room again but I need to make my mind up this morning or I&#8217;ll lose it.  Part of me thinks I should stay in the ward to keep my spirits up etc. but part of me thinks that the people in here could change soon, probably tomorrow&#8230;and also if the chemo is taking it&#8217;s effects now then I&#8217;ll probably feel pretty ill pretty quickly and might just want my own space to sleep and rest.  HELP!!  Send me your words of wisdom and suggestions QUICKLY!!  NOW!!</p>
<p>Well I&#8217;ll finish off now but on a final note&#8230;I now miss Chris&#8217;s Darth Vader breathing as it&#8217;s nothing compared to the lady snoring that was going on last night in here!!  I love you baby and miss you lots and can&#8217;t wait to lie next to Darth Vader again! xxx</p>
<p>I hope everyone has a good day and don&#8217;t forget to comment or message me to keep me going!</p>
<p>Lots of love and hugs xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</p>
<p>P.S. Monday 6th July (this Monday) there&#8217;s a programme on Channel 4 about teenage bone cancer&#8230;sounds like there might be some similar stories to mine so it might be interesting to watch or record xxx</p>

		<p>Hello, I&#8217;m here!!  As promised!  Well I&#8217;m back in the hospital in Oxford.  We got here just after 10 am and after a little stop into the wig shop downstairs (which is closing down tomorrow!!) to change my short wig for a better blonde&#8230;the one I had (which I haven&#8217;t worn!) had big black roots on it&#8230;quite natural I suppose for some people!  But my roots were never THAT dark anyway &amp; I never let them get that out of hand!  So I figured if you don&#8217;t have to pay for highlights for years then why have roots?!!  Anyway so after that I was up to the ward probably by 10.30 am and I didn&#8217;t get started on the chemo until about 6.30 pm I think!  So a long day full of waiting&#8230;but I would actually call it a good day.  It&#8217;s frustrating that I&#8217;ve felt my best today than I have for weeks if not months, yet I was in here!  &amp; for no reason really apart from&#8230;w&#8230;a&#8230;i&#8230;t&#8230;i&#8230;n&#8230;g!!  I was at first given a room to myself but just as I started to settle I was told I&#8217;d have to leave it as there were more men coming in.  They don&#8217;t mix men and women in the wards (shame!!) so I had to leave to go into a ward&#8230;or a bay&#8230;of 4 like I was in for my very first chemo&#8230;.seems sooooooooo long ago&#8230;although it&#8217;s sort of gone quickly which is weird.  Anyway I have mixed feelings about the bay&#8230;I&#8217;ve actually really enjoyed it today cos the other ladies are really chatty which helps to pass the time and keep our spirits up and also it&#8217;s really good to hear other people&#8217;s stories and to remind myself that as bad as it all seems, I&#8217;m really not the only one &amp; I&#8217;m not maybe as worse off as I could possibly be&#8230;although it&#8217;s virtually impossible to remember that sometimes&#8230;on my low days or moments&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;anyway whether it&#8217;s drug related&#8230;mood related&#8230;whatever related&#8230;I&#8217;m having a good day.  Although I&#8217;m fully aware and petrified that could change very quickly literally overnight as they&#8217;re pumping all the chemo drugs into me at the moment.  I&#8217;ll have lots of changes of drips overnight so I doubt I&#8217;ll get alot of sleep but I&#8217;m not actually feeling tired either for the first time in weeks&#8230;if not months!!  Yipeeee!  I&#8217;m wide awake&#8230;and in a room where everyone&#8217;s going to sleep!  &amp; although other people can have their benefits during the day&#8230;I think we do have some snorers in our midst!! (is that right?  In our midst?!  It&#8217;s one of those weird saying and I&#8217;m not good with sayings!  I always that them muddled&#8230;.like that don&#8217;t feed the hungry horse that feeds you or whatever it is?!  &amp; then there&#8217;s the gift horse&#8217;s mouth too&#8230;why are they all about horses?!)  Hey we had a weird conversation today sitting out on the roof terrace&#8230;oooooh roof terrace makes it sound like I&#8217;m in some luxurious hotel&#8230;I wish!  Anyway we were talking about mosquitos because Chris had been bitten and I started wondering whether if a mosquito bit me now and sucked my blood whilst my blood&#8217;s full of chemo, would the mosquito get ill or die from the drugs?!  &amp; then I thought well if mosquitos can get cancer then maybe I could cure them by letting them bite me and have some chemo?!!  Hmmmm?!  Now you&#8217;re probably all shaking your heads in dismay (I know my brother will be!) and laughing AT me but I think I&#8217;m onto something here!  We thought about ringing my professor in charge of my treatment but then we thought better of it!  Think he might be too busy to answer our ponderings about bug cancer!  Anyway (got to stop using that word less. this&#8217;ll never get published!) don&#8217;t worry if you&#8217;re starting to get concerned that I&#8217;ve gone crazy&#8230;those of you that know me well enough will know that I always was!  &amp; I might not have much hair left but what is left is very BLONDE so I&#8217;m allowed to have blonde moments!</p>
<p>Right I&#8217;m offski&#8230;this laptop is pretty and pink but keeps doing funny things and I&#8217;m scared I&#8217;ll lose this if I don&#8217;t post it now.  Plus I suppose it&#8217;s nearly Wednesday now&#8230;I don&#8217;t want to go to bed in case tomorrow&#8217;s a bad day- I want to hold onto my good day!</p>
<p>Please post comments comments comments and more comments, even if it&#8217;s one line or whatever.  Don&#8217;t be scared of knowing what to say.  There&#8217;s no right thing to say.  Just say what comes into your head&#8230;that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m doing and enough of you seem to be reading it!  Please keep the emails, calls, texts, messages, cards etc. coming cos they really do spur me on even if a tiny amount when I&#8217;m feeling low.</p>
<p>Night night hope the bed bugs don&#8217;t bite&#8230;.oh NO back to bugs!!  Hope there&#8217;s none in here to start my clinical mosquito chemo trial!  I could be a legendary bug oncologist (that&#8217;s a cancer specialist by the way &#8211; I didn&#8217;t even know the word oncology until I was told I had cancer 2 months ago!)  Right enough of the bugs&#8230;maybe I am doing a little doolally!!</p>
<p>Love you all.  Hope you enjoyed my rambling tonight!xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</p>

		<p>Hello&#8230;I hope you&#8217;re all having a lovely weekend and enjoying the sunshine!  I can&#8217;t enjoy the sunshine anymore&#8230;I&#8217;ve turned from a sun worshipper to a sun hater!  Well&#8230;not a hater but it&#8217;s just too hot and I&#8217;m too wobbly and weak to enjoy it as it just makes me dizzy!  Plus I was told the chemo makes my skin much more sensitive so factor 50 it is for me!  No more tanning oil like the good old days!</p>
<p>Anyway I&#8217;ve tried to enjoy my weekend as best I can but my so called &#8216;good&#8217; days certainly aren&#8217;t as good this time&#8230;I manage to do less and less as each cycle goes by.  I just feel more tired and weaker and get exhausted so much more easily.  &amp; like I said I&#8217;m still a bit like bambi on ice so I can&#8217;t go too far being so wobbly! </p>
<p>Good news though we did manage to go and see our new house again on Friday evening!  Well, hopefully our new house&#8230;we&#8217;ve had an offer accepted and it is stunning.  We love it and it&#8217;s giving us something to focus on and be positive and look to the future for.  Saying that though I&#8217;m not sure how much use I&#8217;ll be when it comes to moving!!  Zero!  They&#8217;ll have to move me on the bed at this rate.  Maybe I can &#8216;direct&#8217; the moving of our belongings!</p>
<p>Yesterday I managed to go to my niece&#8217;s dance show at a summer fayre.  It was lovely spending some time with my family and getting to see her dance was fantastic and so adorable!  I had my fold up chair to sit on like some old granny!  &amp; with headscarf and sunglasses on my sister said I looked like a film star with a chauffer when I was sitting in my mum&#8217;s car!  My brother in law wasn&#8217;t so kind when he wanted me to earn a bit of cash setting up a fortune telling stand in the pub garden!  We managed to go for some tea afterwards and I managed not to cry all day until it was time to go home when I got a bit emotional!  It&#8217;s so frustrating feeling like this as even on the rare ocassion I can do &#8216;normal&#8217; things, I just don&#8217;t feel like &#8216;me&#8217; anymore so I can&#8217;t be myself.  I just don&#8217;t have the energy and I&#8217;m struggling too much with everything to be able to switch off and relax completely.  But anyway I think I just have to accept that this is a low time and I&#8217;m going to struggle and there won&#8217;t be many days that go by without tears&#8230;there certainly hasn&#8217;t been for a while.  But I&#8217;m desperately trying to focus on positives like how lucky I am to have such an amazing boyfriend and family and friends around me.  I know I keep saying that but it really is true.  I simply could not do this without them.  It&#8217;s hard enough with them!  But they&#8217;ve been truly amazing.  My mum and dad and Chris have spent so much time with me and so much time travelling to and from Oxford to be with me.  &amp; my mum has looked after me everyday at home while Chris has had to go to work as normal.  She&#8217;s been amazing to me and I&#8217;m so glad we&#8217;re so close and able to have such a strong relationship where she can be there for me in the way she is&#8230;.</p>
<p>Anyway I hope I&#8217;m not making anyone cry (my mum probably if she&#8217;s reading this!)  She&#8217;s had a day off from me today (very rare at the moment!)  Chris and I have had a quiet day together.  I don&#8217;t think I could have coped with anything more than that.  Especially after a few nights sleep of getting use to his &#8216;Darth Vader&#8217; breathing again!!  Hee hee, he doesn&#8217;t know I&#8217;m writing this!  He doesn&#8217;t snore, he just breathes like Darth Vader which at the moment seems to wake me at 5 a.m. and keep me awake so I crawl into the spare bed!!  Today we managed to walk into Fleet and have a Starbucks.  I know this doesn&#8217;t sound like much but it&#8217;s quite an achievement for me at the moment!  We had a look at some dream furniture for our dream house and did a few bits but I didn&#8217;t last long before I was too dizzy and wobbly and needed to come home.  I did manage to buy 4 more pairs of pyjamas in the La Senza sale though!  I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;ll do with all my pj&#8217;s when I&#8217;m better because I&#8217;ve got sooooooooooo many now!  I&#8217;ll have to have a pyjama sale!!  To be fair though I need lots of pretty pyjamas because I&#8217;m practically living in them.  I&#8217;ve had to rest for the rest of the day which is annoying as I&#8217;ll be doing enough of that when I&#8217;m back in hospital but I have to do what my body tells me to do and at the moment it&#8217;s definitely telling me to rest!</p>
<p>Well I&#8217;ll shut up now but I&#8217;m going to try to write on here more often now just to try to give myself a focus and keep myself sane&#8230;.so even if no-one&#8217;s reading it I&#8217;ll just keep writing!  But many of you are telling me you&#8217;re reading&#8230;in fact a lot more than I ever imagined and that&#8217;s inspires me to want to keep strong and keep going&#8230;although I&#8217;m struggling at the moment.  I don&#8217;t want to cut myself off so please do write a comment if you&#8217;re reading cos every comment, email, text, message, card I receive gives me a little push upwards and I need every tiny uplifting moment that I can grab onto at the moment&#8230;</p>
<p>Love you all xxx</p>
