		<p>This week has been nice and busy and full of things I love to do and people I love to see!  The weekend was very wedding orientated&#8230;no, not mine!  On Saturday I went wedding dress shopping with Laura again&#8230;this time Gemma W (her other bridesmaid) and I went with her to Basingstoke&#8230;but there was an accident on the M3 and it took us over 2 hours to get from Fleet to Basingstoke!  The other side of the motorway was totally closed and our side was at a complete standstill so everyone was turning their engines off and getting out of their cars.  I chose not to though, didn&#8217;t fancy hobbling around on my crutches just for the sake of it&#8230;and didn&#8217;t want my wig blowing off on the M3, even if it was a temporary car park at the time!  Instead, us girls passed the time by doing what we do best&#8230;chatting&#8230;and looking at firemen!  Luck was on our side as there was a fire engine right next to us and we found out that if we looked at it long enough, firemen appeared out of it!  &amp; they were not disappointing!  Well, one of them wasn&#8217;t anyway!  I&#8217;ll leave the rest to your imaginations!  Anyway we eventually got there and Laura tried on some beautiful dresses&#8230;like a true princess!  I&#8217;ll say no more as they&#8217;re top secret&#8230;the quest for &#8216;the one&#8217; continues though!  Saturday night was spent with Simon Cowell in the world of X Factor&#8230;Chris was away for the weekend &#8211; he went to stay with his brother in Manchester, although after a night out on the beers with his bro and bro in law, his brother &#8216;wandered off&#8217; which is what he does best after a few drinks, so predictably they didn&#8217;t get home together and Chris had to go home with Darren his bro in law instead, waking up his poor sister Emma!  So I had a very peaceful night&#8217;s sleep!  On Sunday I went with Ollie &amp; Laura (&amp; Gemma) to see the venue for their wedding (Ollie &amp; Laura&#8217;s, not Ollie, Laura &amp; Gemma&#8217;s!)&#8230;it&#8217;s absolutely lovely and really nice to picture now where the big day will be.  Although I&#8217;m now petrified because we&#8217;ve got to walk down a very grand staircase into the room where they&#8217;ll get married&#8230;I&#8217;ll probably trip and create a domino effect knocking Gemma and Laura down the stairs!  &amp; then if Laura&#8217;s trying to steal my wig, we&#8217;ll have a fight!  It&#8217;ll be a memorable day anyway!</p>
<p>Then the highlights of this week have been:</p>
<p>Lunch &amp; the afternoon spent with my sister and the scamps (my nieces!)</p>
<p>A mammoth shopping trip to Primark&#8230;it&#8217;s been far too long so I went a bit crazy!  No guilt involved though as everything&#8217;s so bargainous!  Love that place!</p>
<p>A bit more shopping&#8230;oops!</p>
<p>A dinner out &amp; a good chat with Gemma &amp; Lou</p>
<p>A visit to my Nana, also with Goose, my aunt Corinne, my sister and the scamps again!</p>
<p>A morning making cupcakes and making lots of mess and licking lots of spoons! (I&#8217;ll post photos soon!)</p>
<p>An afternoon with Gillie spent eating the cupcakes and chatting away!&#8230;and giving the grand tour of our lovely house!</p>
<p>&#8230;tonight we&#8217;re having fajitas, mmmm my favourite and watching a film of my choice!  No doubt Chris will be asleep soon anyway as he&#8217;s only just got back from working in Wales.</p>
<p>Tomorrow is back to the world of hospitals for an appointment in clinic with Prof.   Hopefully there&#8217;ll be no surprises and no tears&#8230;but I&#8217;ll take my eyelash glue just in case!  Chemo is on Monday and is now looming&#8230;but I&#8217;ve got lots to look forward to first&#8230;.friends round tomorrow night for some food and games (Wii time!) and then we&#8217;re going away with Ollie &amp; Laura for the weekend to stay with Ally &amp; Emma, so looking forward to that.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got so much in my head I want to write on here, some good, some not so good&#8230;but I&#8217;ll split into day by day so I don&#8217;t bombard you all at once.  Thank  you for my comments, and thanks to the new commenters, I love finding out who&#8217;s been reading!</p>
<p>Love you all xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</p>

		<p>My last few posts have been very girly and focused on hair (wigs!) and eyelashes (just bought some more today!)  So today here&#8217;s a pic that my male readers might prefer&#8230;my scar.  Boys like scars don&#8217;t they?!  Well not on girls, my legs are NOT attractive now!  Not that I liked them before but I didn&#8217;t know how lucky I was!  But I&#8217;m sure if I was a boy I&#8217;d be showing off my &#8216;war wound&#8217;?!  So here it is, it gives you an idea of the extent of the surgery&#8230;  I&#8217;ve just realised how dodgy that sounds &#8211; One for the boys!  Sorry if I got your hopes up, it&#8217;s nothing like THAT!! </p>
<div style="float:right;padding-left:15px;"><a rel="attachment wp-att-163" href="../../../blog/one-for-the-boys/p011109_1931_01/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-163" title="p011109_1931_01" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/11/p011109_1931_01-225x300.jpg" alt="p011109_1931_01" width="225" height="300" /></a></div>
<p>I&#8217;ve decided that telling people it&#8217;s a shark bite is a much more interesting story!  I was swimming in the ocean when Bruce from Finding Nemo came along and for a second he forgot that he&#8217;s a vegetarian and took a big bite but then he remembered and spat me out!  He felt really bad and was very sorry.  Bear (my bear, not Ollie!) scared him off and he was never to be seen again!</p>
<p>On a more serious note, I&#8217;m actually thinking about doing a course from home in creative writing&#8230;it was Goose&#8217;s idea and a very good one I think.  I&#8217;ve always wanted to be an author since I was about 3 I think!  I&#8217;ve always dreamed of writing children&#8217;s books but now I&#8217;d also love to write adult books (not as in ADULT books though!  Ha ha!)  but most of all at the moment I want to write my story of cancer as a book.  I think doing a course would give my brain a focus and would also be something productive to gain from my time.  I&#8217;m investigating it at the moment, there&#8217;s a few I&#8217;ve come across including How to Write a Bestseller and Children&#8217;s book writing&#8230;watch this space!</p>
<p>Right, I shall try to write more later&#8230;I&#8217;m busy this week trying to fit everything I want to do in and everyone I want to see&#8230;which is impossible.  Monday&#8217;s return to chemo is now looming and Friday&#8217;s taken up with yet another visit to Oxford to see Prof again.  The only trouble is, as I&#8217;m so busy, I&#8217;m wearing myself out and am feeling the strain!  Thanks again for all your comments and emails I&#8217;ve had too&#8230;if you&#8217;d rather email me than comment on here my email address is <a href="mailto:cara_yapp@yahoo.co.uk">cara_yapp@yahoo.co.uk</a>&#8230;</p>
<p>Bye for now xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
		<p style="text-align: left;">Thank you for all your comments&#8230;although I did say I wasn&#8217;t fishing for compliments!  Although you&#8217;re hardly going to say &#8220;Oh my god you gave me a fright, you look like Uncle Fester!!&#8221;  Good timing for Halloween anyway I guess!!</p>
<p>Now for some slightly more attractive photos (note, I say SLIGHTLY!!)  I want to show you all 4 Caras&#8230;there&#8217;s me as me, as in bald is as good as it gets at the moment!  There&#8217;s Jen my original trusty blonde wig which has been on here before (named by Anna after Jennifer Aniston FYI!)  The &#8216;wig&#8217; name for her was &#8216;Relentless&#8217;&#8230;Jen&#8217;s much better!  Although relentless does describe what I&#8217;m going through very well, you can&#8217;t name her that!  Notice how I refer to them as &#8216;her&#8217; and &#8216;she&#8217;, don&#8217;t worry I haven&#8217;t gone crazy&#8230;well no more than I already was!  Anyway then there&#8217;s Maria who I accidentally (I&#8217;m good at accidental shopping!) bought when trying her on for the style as I wanted this style in blonde (still do!) but then fell in love with her.  She&#8217;s named after Maria in Coronation Street who&#8217;s hair is gorgeous and I&#8217;ve always loved!  I love the curls and play with it non stop when I&#8217;m wearing her!  The &#8216;wig&#8217; name for her was Stevie!  You can&#8217;t name a girl Stevie!!  Then there&#8217;s another accidental purchase&#8230;Rachel&#8230;named after Rachel from Friends back in the day (Jennifer Aniston&#8217;s featuring highly here I know!)  She was bought the day I got the good news about &#8230;hmmm hang on, which time was it?!  I can&#8217;t even remember but I know there&#8217;d been some kind of glimmer of hope type news from Prof so again I went into the wig shop to search for Maria in blonde but tried her on and thought I deserved a &#8216;celebration wig&#8217;!  She was supposed to be called Mia or something like that&#8230;</p>
<p>Wig shopping is the new clothes shopping when you don&#8217;t get out much and there&#8217;s a wig shop right there in the hospital!  I go in nearly everytime I pass now and the lady in there knows me well!  I&#8217;m always saying &#8220;oooh that one&#8217;s nice, have I tried that one on?!&#8221;  Followed by a chorus of &#8220;YES!&#8221; from Goose and the lady who works in there!  I always end up trying them on again though!  My search for Holly (Holly Willoughby who I LOVE!!  I&#8217;m on a mission to meet her!) continues&#8230;when she has her hair curly, that&#8217;s what I want soooooo much!  It&#8217;s just a LOT more pricey than clothes shopping however&#8230;there&#8217;s no Primark in the world of wigs!</p>
<p>Anyway so here they all are&#8230;I slapped on my make up (literally!), secured my false eyelashes (although obviously not well enough as one fell off whilst Chris and I had dinner in the pub last night!  Why doesn&#8217;t that ever happen to Cheryl Cole who&#8217;s CLEARLY wearing them at all times?!  Maybe money &amp; fame can buy you superglue for eyelashes?!) and had a mini photo shoot with Goose with me bald, Jen, Maria and Rachel!  Check out my eyelashes!&#8230;(mine have fallen out from the chemo)</p>

<p>Right, please let me know which is your favourite!!  Don&#8217;t say bald just because you feel you should!  I&#8217;m interested to know which wig is the favourite!  So even if you&#8217;re reading and you don&#8217;t usually comment, just write on here which Cara you prefer!!</p>
<p>&#8230;on that note, people keep telling me of people who are reading this site but not commenting as they don&#8217;t feel they  know me well enough or know me at all!  I&#8217;m intrigued to know who&#8217;s reading &amp; I really don&#8217;t mind if you haven&#8217;t seen me since I was a little scamp or even if you&#8217;ve never met me, just write a comment, I won&#8217;t bite!  I&#8217;ll honestly be happy to read a comment from anyone, it&#8217;d be good to know who&#8217;s reading!</p>
<p>Right, cast your vote now&#8230;Jen, Maria or Rachel (or bald but probably not!) xxx</p>
<p>P.S. I apologise for the awful appearance of this post&#8230;I cannot work out how to sort it out&#8230;I get it all lined up and in the right place on my admin part of the site and then when I post it on the site it all jumps around and puts in a million gaps!  Sorry!  Hope you can make sense of it! x</p>

		<p>I feel it&#8217;s time that I shared with you my baldness&#8230;it&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve been dealing with for nearly 6 months now as it started straight after my very first chemo.  At home I&#8217;m happy (well, not exactly happy?!) being bald with Chris and my family and even with my friends.  Anyone who&#8217;s close to me will have seen me bald.  I&#8217;m yet to go out in public in all my baldness&#8230;Anna thinks I should as she thinks I look lovely?!   Hmmm, that&#8217;s debatable!  I can see why Jade Goody did it and why Gail Porter does it and I truly think they both look/looked good with it.  I do feel half the time that I&#8217;m wearing a wig to make other people comfortable rather than myself!  Sometimes if it&#8217;s hot or itchy I just want to take it off but I know it would shock!  Also though, I can blend in with my wig on as people genuinly don&#8217;t notice and so don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m ill or any different from anyone else.  Sometimes this is a good thing and I can be &#8216;normal&#8217; but sometimes it&#8217;s frustrating, especially now I&#8217;m on crutches when clearly everyone just assumes I&#8217;ve broken my leg or something&#8230;I&#8217;ve had so many random strangers ask me &#8220;So what have you done then?&#8221; or as one woman working in Tesco kindly said &#8220;What have you done then you silly girl?!&#8221; &#8230; I had to walk (crutch!) away and pretend I hadn&#8217;t heard as I was fuming and to answer &#8220;I&#8217;ve got cancer&#8221; would have been far too shocking and harsh for her to handle, I&#8217;m sure she would have been mortified!  Satisfying for me in a way but I would have felt too guilty!  Again, thinking of making other people feel comfortable, not myself!  Not that I really felt like discussing my illness with a complete stranger working in Tesco!  It just goes to show you shouldn&#8217;t make assumptions and you can&#8217;t take things at face value as you just don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going on with people  you pass in everyday life.  But then again most of us have the common sense and manners not to call someone you&#8217;ve never seen before in your life &#8216;a silly girl&#8217;!!</p>
<p>Anyway, I&#8217;m going to share some bald photos with you&#8230;I don&#8217;t know why, I guess just because this is me now and it will be for a long time so I feel like sharing.  I&#8217;m not fishing for comments telling me I look lovely because I know I don&#8217;t but that&#8217;s not the idea!  Thank goodness for wigs and make up and false eyelashes but this are photos without any of that!  I&#8217;ll have to make myself up with my fake lashes and my other wigs so you can see them too but for now, this is me bare faced and bare headed&#8230;!<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-129" title="My last bits of hair...plaited!" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/10/p160909_2057-225x300.jpg" alt="My last bits of hair...plaited!" width="225" height="300" /></p>
<p>Desperately clinging onto my last bits of hair&#8230;during a long and boring hospital stay Anna plaited them for me!  She said she&#8217;d made me look like Little Miss Sunshine with my mini pigtails!</p>

<p>It&#8217;s amazing how cold your head gets when you&#8217;ve got no hair!  My woolly hat is never far away in the house, a lot more cosy than wearing a wig!  It&#8217;s crazy the way my hair loss happened, the bulk of it fell out really quickly the first week after the first chemo.  But I was left with just a bit left at the front for months and months.  I constantly debated over whether or not to shave it but I spent so long in hospital and when I was out the first thing on my list of things to do wasn&#8217;t really shaving my head!  Anyway after surgery when I was on my break from chemo, the rest of it fell out!  Bizarre!  So I was only left with a few long hairs here and there which I got my mum to cut for me!  &amp; then Chris enjoyed an evening cuddled up on the sofa, plucking out long hairs that he kept spotting!  He loved it!  We must have looked like monkeys when they pick nits from each others&#8217; heads!  Nice!  Certainly no nits on my head, they&#8217;d have nowhere to live and you&#8217;d definitely see them!  Now I have a very slight regrowth of stubble but it&#8217;s very soft and very short and I think it&#8217;s stopped again as I&#8217;m back on the chemo.  Watch this space&#8230;!</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve now made it to Friday without going neutropenic!  It&#8217;s a miracle!  I went into Frimley Park Hospital on Monday for a blood check and as predicted I did have to stay in.  However, it was progress as I wasn&#8217;t neutropenic, I was just (I say just!) anaemic and needed a  unit blood transfusion and platelets.  So I stayed in and had that on Tuesday and was out by Wednesday lunchtime!  Today I&#8217;ve been back for another blood count check just in case but I haven&#8217;t heard anything so I&#8217;m assuming everything&#8217;s ok, otherwise I&#8217;d be whizzed back in and put on a drip and antibiotics faster than I could say &#8220;but&#8230;!&#8221;</p>
<p>So, this is what I wanted and means I can continue chemo on the reduced dose.  Mixed feelings are brewing however&#8230;I&#8217;d kind of got use to the idea of having to stop and although this scared me due to the prospects of the cancer coming back if I hadn&#8217;t completed the course, I&#8217;d started to get secretly excited about not having to go through the chemo anymore and the thought of being a step closer to getting my life back&#8230; However I have to focus on why I&#8217;m going through it and I&#8217;m not getting this far to stop too soon so I will continue on my &#8216;journey&#8217;&#8230;I have the option to stop at anytime now if it&#8217;s too much  for me but no matter how tempting it is I WILL NOT BE DEFEATED by this!  I&#8217;m telling myself that as much as I&#8217;m telling you!</p>
<p>Anyway I&#8217;ve managed to fit in lots of visits this week&#8230;mainly due to it being half-term and so I&#8217;ve seen lots of my teacher friends!  On Tuesday my friend Vicky came to see me.  We did teacher training together and were very close but now she&#8217;s living back in Jersey (on the rock as she calls it!) where she&#8217;s from so it&#8217;s been over 2 years since I&#8217;d seen her!  Unfortunately I was in hospital for her visit, but it was still lovely to catch up after so long.  Then on Wednesday I left hospital by 12 and had already managed to plan a visit from Katie and Allie who I use to work with at Frogmore.  So they came round to see my house and we went out for a lovely lunch and chatted and gossiped until we realised it was 6pm!  Oops!  On Thursday my friend J came to visit, who I also did teacher training with.  We lived together in Southampton after we qualified too.  She&#8217;s now living in Colchester so we don&#8217;t see each other as much as we&#8217;d like but she&#8217;s been brilliant at sending me things to make me smile since I&#8217;ve been ill and she&#8217;s been to visit quite a few times too.</p>
<p>S0 I&#8217;ve been a lucky girl this week with visits!  Today I had to go to hospital (yawn!) for blood tests and for physio (not so yawn!)  A young fit male stroking my leg&#8230;and my bum today&#8230;!  It&#8217;s part of the exercises!!  IT IS!!  The good news is I&#8217;m now allowed to walk without wearing the leg splint that I&#8217;ve had to strap onto me for the past 7 weeks.  It feels weird, weak and wobbly but it&#8217;s progress so I&#8217;m happy.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m in a funny mood today, a bit frustrated by the limitations I have on me&#8230;even when I&#8217;ve recovered from the worst effects of the chemo I&#8217;m still so dependant on other people to help me because of my leg.  The worst thing about being on crutches is not being able to carry anything!  &amp; that it hurts your hands&#8230;&amp; that they fall over everytime you try to prop them up&#8230;ok ok so there&#8217;s quite a few annoying things about being on crutches but I won&#8217;t go on!  I still remind myself constantly that I&#8217;m lucky to have my leg and lucky to be here.  Maybe I&#8217;m not so lucky having got cancer in the first place but I can&#8217;t dwell on that and must  focus on the positives&#8230;</p>
<p>My dinner&#8217;s ready now, prepared by Jamie Oliver AKA Chris Newton!   I&#8217;ll write again soon and I think I need to jazz this site up with some photos so I&#8217;ll do my best&#8230;</p>
<p>Ciao for now! xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</p>

		<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>From Costa to hospital…back blogging!  (Can I just point out that I prefer Starbucks but it’s further to go on my crutches to get there!  Let’s start the Costa V Starbucks vote…comments welcome!)  Since my last entry it’s been a bit of a rollercoaster of ups and downs.  I would have been back on here sooner but still with no internet at home and trying to fill my last few days of freedom, it didn’t happen!  I had a few more days ‘at home’ but Thursday was mostly spent going to Physio at Frimley Park Hospital but that was with a very nice young man who was very helpful and encouraging!  &#038; I did manage to catch up with my Aunt &#038; my Nana who were at Frimley Park at the same time!  Then we also popped into my sister’s and it was lovely to see her and my 3 nieces as always.  Apart from I put my crutches right down to the smallest they would go so Eden (7) could have a go and then they got stuck and we couldn’t get them back up again!  Oops!  I thought I’d have to stay on Thalia’s sofa forever but luckily she got them back up again eventually!  Thanks Thalia!  They came round the weekend before and Anna and I made some cupcakes and we let them decorate them with chocolate butter icing and all sorts of sweets…</p>
<p>Buttons… Smarties … Maltesers… Percy Pigs from M&#038;S (love them!)  It was hilarious watching them decorate them and piling on the sweeties!  They never fail to cheer me up and make me happy!  Then after being there all afternoon, Daisy (4) looked at me and said “Why are you on crunches anyway?!”  “For my leg remember!” I replied…followed by “Oh yeah!”  Haha, so they’re now known as crunches!  I love how they’re so innocent and so adaptable, they just take it all in their stride and accept all these strange things happening to me!  Although they do much prefer to see me in my wig than bald!  &#038; Zara (2) gets scared and holds onto her hair as if we’re going to try and take hers off!!</p>
<p>Anyway back to the point…I could tell stories about them all day!  Chris and I went out for a lovely meal on Thursday evening as we knew it’d be a while before we could again.  So a good feed prepared me for the Friday ahead and my appointment with Prof.  So although Friday was a ‘good’ day it was spent in hospital also!  I knew it’d be a big discussion due to the fact that I went neutropenic again last time even though he had said it’d be much less likely.  &#038; after my Prof in Frimley had been so matter of fact about my life being at risk everytime that happens, I knew we’d have to have a thorough conversation about what’s to happen next.  I didn’t quite bank on it being quite as heavy though and it was just so much information to take in and conversations I knew I’d have to have at some point, stuff you need to hear but don’t necessarily want to…</p>
<p>Basically he started by saying that if I want to I can have the chemo administered at a private hospital in Guildford, to be closer to home.  I would be under the care of my Prof from Frimley (Professor Smith) and would still visit Oxford every 3 weeks for clinic and review with Prof  (Professor Hassan – my hero!)  Obviously this would have it’s benefits but I’m not so sure about changing at this stage as although coming to Oxford has it’s drawbacks, at least I know what to expect and know lots of the staff and feel on the whole that I can trust them.  I don’t know if I want to start all over again at this stage.  He could see this doubt in me and I expressed to him how I felt about it and he said if I wanted to I could have an extra week of feeling ‘better ish’ to think things through before proceeding chemo.  I very quickly said no.  Although I would’ve loved more than anything to have an extra week at home before going through this again, I’d have just been delaying the inevitable and I’d rather carry on as planned and see this thing through as best I can.  I’m psyched up to do it mentally, it’s just the question of whether my body can survive it and the hardest thing is that I have no control over what my own body is doing. </p>
<p>He then went on to say my recent CT scan on my chest was fine in terms of my heart’s still ok, but “Do you know you’ve got gall stones?!”  “Urm, no!”  At this point I’m thinking, for goodness sake, when will this end!!  He said they’re relatively small at the moment and lots of people have them and don’t know about them, just to keep an eye out for any symptoms and I may need to do something about them at some point.  But not a priority at the moment!  So back to the more pressing issues, he made it clear that in this stage of the ‘game’ I have a red button in front of me at all times and if I want to stop chemo now, then I stop.  Again I said no extremely quickly.  Some of you might be thinking I’m mad and surely that’s what I want?  Well of course I would love more than anything to stop but it’s not as simple as that.  If they plan to give me 14 sessions, I want to have as close to 14 sessions as I can…I’m not going through all I’ve been through to stop early if I can possibly help it.  Which is why I have such mixed feelings about what he told me next…they’ve reduced the dosage of 2 of the chemo drugs by 20% for the round I’m on now.  If I still go neutropenic next week (for the 8th time in a row) then they’ll have to stop.  I think I felt more scared at that point than I have through all of this.  Again that might sound silly to you but it’s the prospect of stopping before they want me to and the fear of the cancer coming back.  But I have to listen to them and it’s their job to weigh up and strike a balance between the risks and the benefits and if they’re telling me it’s getting too dangerous and my life is at risk from the neutropenia more than it could potentially be from the cancer then I have to listen to them and go with it.  This then went on to the inevitable discussion of survival rates with my cancer and likelihood of cancer returning.  He explained it very clearly although it’s still hard to get your head around!  Basically the highest risk period of cancer returning is the first 5 years, and within that the first 2 years is the most at risk time.  From everyone who has Ewing’s Sarcoma, 60% will be ok and 40% will not (cancer will return within the first 5 years, some treated successfully, some sadly not)  From people who’s cancer had spread on diagnosis, only 10-20% will be ok in the first 5 years and 80-90% will not.  Luckily for me I’m not in that group as it was caught fairly early and had not spread.  I can’t help thinking of all those poor people who aren’t as lucky.  My group is the best (but the best of the worst I guess!), where 75% are ok and 25% are not.  He said in simple terms you can expect for 1 in 4 people in my category will get cancer return in the first 2 years.  I know compared to the other figures that’s positive, but compared to ‘normal’ (whatever that is!) it’s pretty scary and to see it in black and white and to be told it straight up is a pretty scary prospect.  Usually if the cancer returns it’s most likely to be in the lungs, which is why I’ll have regular checks and scans to monitor this.</p>
<p>When the chemo ends, whether that’s February or in the next few weeks or somewhere in between, I’ll have to have radiotherapy.  He said the plan isn’t definite yet as they discuss these things in large teams, but it’ll probably be everyday for 3-4 weeks.  This is in case any cells have been left around the area where the tumour was so the radiotherapy will be concentrated on that area.  But of course as with anything, there are risks involved.  I knew radiotherapy can make you tired, can damage skin and sometimes make you feel poorly but from what I’ve heard it’s nowhere near as bad as the effects of chemo and I cannot imagine anything being worse than that!  But the risks he had to tell me about were much more than just these symptoms.  He said radiotherapy there, because it’s focused on where the prosthetic (the metal) has been put in, it can loosen the bone around the prosthetic and can damage the prosthetic.  Great, it’s just been put in!  &#038; more scarily, there’s new research starting to find that radiotherapy on joints can make it more likely for a different type of cancer to return in that same place in years to come, like when I’m 60 or 70.  He said due to all these things, some people choose to say no to radiotherapy.   I’m sure I need and will get more information before making my decision as I’ve got to get through the chemo first, but the way I see it, if it’s less likely for cancer to return again in my 20s, but more likely to get it when I’m 60 or 70 then I’ll have it and at least live some of my life first!  It’s not as simple as that of course.  But then like my dad pointed out, they have to tell you absolutely everything and it’s very new research and we could be talking about very small risks, they just have to inform you.</p>
<p>The other thing that really scares me, which might also sound stupid, is finishing treatment and returning to ‘normal’ life.  All I’ve known, for what seems like so long now, is being a cancer patient and being in and out of hospital and just getting through each day at a time.  Obviously I’m excited about getting my life back but it seems so daunting and I feel lost thinking about it.  I know I’m not alone in this from the few cancer patients I’ve got contact with and from reading Lance Armstrong’s book (a fantastic read FYI, an amazing story and he survived against all odds.  It was so good for me to relate to and very inspiring – although everyone keeps telling me I am and I don’t feel I am!!  Maybe my book will be out there one day!)  Anyway, he says, when his treatment’s over ‘I don’t have cancer but I don’t not have cancer’ and he found that really hard to deal with at first and had no interest in anything.  I can relate to that cos it’s not just as simple as one day it’s gone.  I guess that’s something I never really thought about before or understood.  They can think it’s gone but at the end of the day it only takes one cell to start multiplying again and it can be back.  It’ll be so hard not to be paranoid about every little ache and pain and with so many checks in those first few days not to worry, worry, worry whilst trying to build my life back up.  Anyway, one day at a time still, that’s the only way I think as you just don’t know what’s around the corner! …apart from planning holidays – that’s a must!</p>
<p>There was more info from Prof but I think you’ve had enough to take in (as I did!) so here’s for some more light-hearted stories!  I wore my ‘Maria’ wig on Friday (name after Maria from Corrie!  But more like how she used to have it, with more highlights but brown, long, gorgeous curls)  I thought it might be fun to confuse them (Goose’s idea!) and it did!  The nurses apparently were looking for me in the waiting room and couldn’t see me cos didn’t recognise me!  Then the research nurse thought she’d walked into the wrong room when she saw me in there!  They were expecting blonde and pinkness!!  Then during our meeting I managed to hold it together but at one point I had a few tears when I was trying to get my words out when talking about survival rates.  It was literally 2 tears but my fake eyelash (I’ve lost my eyelashes now) decided to hang off!  So in the middle of talking life and death, I was holding my eyelash on and Prof was offering me some glue!  I said I didn’t think Pritt Stick would do it but luckily I had my eyelash glue in my bag (well prepared!) …so there he is discussing all these serious matters &#038; I’m standing at his mirror gluing my eyelash back on!!  Then I got home and had to tell Chris everything I’d been told as unfortunately he’d had to work so couldn’t come to my appointment.  So that opened the floodgates and it was a lot more than 2 tears!  He was giving me a hug and took something from my cheek and said “There’s a feather on your face!”  Then held it up…it was no feather, it was my flippin eyelash!  At least your mascara doesn’t run when you cry but I think the whole things falling off may be worse!</p>
<p>Anyway despite all the worry I managed to enjoy my weekend with a trip to the cinema with Anna Friday night (the film was quite sad…not what I needed! Oh well!) then we spent until about midnight looking around Tesco, me on my crunches(!) looking at clothes, home stuff, all sorts!  We’ve changed!  From bars and clubs to Tesco!  Anna was a great support and we talked through everything and she helped me as always…I’m sure it must be boring her by now but she assures me it’s not!!  It wasn’t until I got home and stopped and tried to sleep that everything I’d been told was hitting me and I just couldn’t sleep or stop crying with so much flying through my head.  For me being busy and talking about things are the key so lying quietly in bed trying to sleep is the worst time for me!  So the rest of the weekend was spent busy with a few ‘wobbly’ moments!  Saturday was very exciting as I went wedding dress shopping with Laura for her first wedding dress trying on session!  She looked beautiful in them all, stunning in fact!  &#038; I can’t write anymore about that as Bear (Ollie, her fiancée – my IT manager!  May be reading this!)  As her chief bridesmaid I felt very proud and honoured!  Gemma, her other bridesmaid came too and we tried on a few bridesmaid dresses but it’s hard to picture them in the right sizes and right colours, but there were lovely ones to say the least.  So that was exciting and then we went for a nice lunch and had a good old chatter as always and talked through all I’d been bombarded with on Friday.  Saturday night and X Factor night!  Jo your rap/rhyme on here is more appropriate than you’ll ever know in so many ways and it made me laugh and cry all at once!  Fantastic as I’ve told you so stop worrying!  Saturday night with Simon Cowell it was! (&#038; Sunday!) Ollie &#038; Laura, Gemma W &#038; Chris O came round and the 6 of us watched X Factor (with lots of  pausing and rewinding with all the talking!) and had dominos pizza!  Perfect night in with me in my woolly hat to keep my bald head warm!</p>
<p>Sunday was another busy day of Chris and I going to ‘look’ at furniture and oops stumbled across some bargains not to be missed and bought a lush corner sofa for our lounge (£600 instead of £2700!!  BARGAIN!)  It’s coming tomorrow!  &#038; a lovely oak dining table with cream leather chairs, should arrive by Christmas so we’ll have lots of dinner parties once I’m ok.  I’ve found myself, since Friday, stop saying ‘when I’m better’ as I don’t feel I will be ‘better’.  I guess that’s where ‘in remission’ is a funny term – like Lance Armstrong said you don’t have cancer but you don’t not have cancer.  A strange in between feeling.  Anyway…Sunday, then my brother came round to see my and the house and so did Gemma H.  I’m afraid my last blog I think worried her and Lou slightly that I don’t think they’d been there for me or they’d upset me, which isn’t the case at all.  I’m sorry if I’ve worried anyone over what I wrote last time – I want to make clear it’s my no means the majority that I feel don’t understand.  As I’ve said loads and loads I feel soooooooooooooooooo lucky for Chris, my friends and family and the support network I’ve got and so many people are there for me.  It’s definitely the minority who I feel sometimes don’t understand so well but I understand why they may not know what’s going on, cos they’re not as close and don’t see me as much and may not want to risk saying the wrong thing.  Everyone deals with things differently and I have to understand that.  Not everyone talks non stop about everything like me!  &#038; my last blog I needed a rant and like I’ve said before I don’t want to hold back on here.  It’s for me and it’s for you so I try to strike a balance between ranting with my doom and gloom but at the same time telling you the funny more light hearted stories as that’s lots of them too!  Anyway so it was great to see my bro and to have a proper chat and catch up with Gemma.</p>
<p>So Sunday finished with X Factor (YAY!)  What are those twins about???  Hilarious but sooooooo bad!  I’m glad Rikki Eyebrow (what is with his eyebrow?!) went out of him and Rachel but I think she’ll be gone soon too.  We’ve got a couple of sweepstakes going with our friends where we pick names out of a hat!  &#038; also we’ve done Xtra Factor style where we all write down who we think we’ll win and put it in a top secret envelope not to be opened until the final!  We’re sad but it’s fun!  Then back to reality with packing for hospital and setting the alarm for Monday morning.  After waiting aaaaaaaalllllllll day on Monday, over 10 hours, my chemo got started.  But there was lots of muddle ups and some drugs had still not arrived so I’ve had it all in funny orders this time.  It was looking as though I’d have to stay until tomorrow but ‘the dream team’ (Team Cara/Team Scamp! That’s Prof, his registrar Saka and Research Nurse Anna.  All been brilliant and lovely) have just been round and they say they can speed up the Mesna a bit (that’s what protects my kidneys and bladder) so I should be finished by about 6pm tonight and be able to go home…IF all goes to plan, we don’t assume anything anymore, it never runs smoothly in hospitals!  Anyway so I haven’t been sick, touch wood, I’m just totally wiped out.  My friend Su who lives in Oxford visited on Monday and we  had a good catch up and Al visited me yesterday and brightened up the nurses day – “There’s a man here to see you!  He’s in a suit!  He’s very handsome!”  When he came to the door, I cruelly said “Ah no, that’s just Ally!!”  Sorry!  Was lovely to have a long chat and catch up and I even had the door shut on me as I was making too much noise chatting!  Oops!  Some things don’t change!</p>
<p>Right I’ve gone on too long…again!  Thank you for all my comments, keep them coming!</p>
<p>Lots of love xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</p>

		<p>Hi all!</p>
<p>I’m very excited to be blogging, I wish I could’ve been doing it every day as I’ve actually felt like doing it but we don’t have the internet in our new house yet and unfortunately I spent last week back in hospital where the wireless connection was awful and everytime I got online it disconnected!  I’m now in Costa coffee using their free wireless so I can blog!  I had to get out of the house today…as lovely as it is I hadn’t been out of it since Sunday and I just needed to for my own sanity so Goose brought me into Fleet for a bit of retail therapy and coffee and internet usage!  I feel more sane now!  Although it’s not easy on crutches, if you think I can be clumsy ordinarily you should’ve seen me today, I must’ve knocked about 30 things over with my crutches in one shop, I was making a right show of myself!  Good job my wig didn’t fly off aswell!  Although it’s obviously convincing because in Dorothy Perkins she was trying to persuade me to sign up for a store card and the incentive was all these discounts in local salons…OBVIOUSLY that’s not going to persuade me at the moment!!</p>
<p>Anyway I’m getting distracted…so the update (brief version) is…</p>
<p>The last time I posted was when I’d just got out of the Nuffield Orthapedic Centre 2 and a half weeks after surgery and I’d had the good news from Prof about the response of the tumour to the chemo.  Thank you for everyone’s messages, cards, texts etc.  Each and every one of them means alot to me and I truly mean that.  I’ve been up and down since then…chemo started again on the Monday and unfortunately I was very sick from it again which was a shock after so long of not being sick.  It was shorter than it used to be and I was home by the Wednesday evening.  Except I couldn’t really go home as our lives were packed up into boxes and I don’t think I’d have managed the stairs etc. in our old tiny house very well!  So we went to my parents in the meantime which was fine but I did feel like a bit of a traveller just living out of a bag with my pj’s and wash bag and not knowing where I’d be sleeping from one night to the next…old house? new house? parent’s house?  or hospital?(most likely!)  Anyway so some predictably dodgy days in a post chemo haze (hey, that rhymes!!) and I struggled with the chemo effects alongside the surgery effects struggling to walk and make myself do my physio exercises when feeling so rough after chemo.  Going from my ‘break’ with no chemo and my leg feeling fine, to weeks of being bed bound after surgery and then being blasted with chemo again, it hit me pretty hard and I just wanted it to stop…but it can’t so that’s that!  Oh well!  (that’s mine and Anna’s motto!  If you say “Oh well!” after anything that seems bad,  it’ll seem ok!!  At least that’s the theory!)  Actually it started once when we’d had a curry and Anna said she was sooooo full she couldn’t posssibly eat anymore but then she looked at the curry left on her plate and said “Oh well!” and proceeded to shove more in her mouth and clear her plate!!  Haha sorry Anna, hope you don’t mind me sharing that story!</p>
<p>Anyway I digress again, sorry it’s because I haven’t been on her for so long, I’m babbling on!  So after a few days out of hospital we completed on our house on Friday 2nd October on Chris’s birthday…YAY!  I was very excited and wanted Chris’s birthday to be special too but I was still feel awful and shattered from the chemo but tried to keep my spirits up regardless.  Until…Friday morning after giving Chris his presents I felt I needed a nap before trying to face even getting up to attempt going to the house (even though I’d have been useless on my crutches and sitting down to avoid collapsing every 2 minutes!  Anyway so I rolled over to snooze and noticed blood on the duvet and then my arm…my Picc Line which I had put back in on the Monday (that’s ANOTHER story!) had been bleeding.  I HATE the site of blood and it totally panicked me!  Anyway to cut a long story short, we eventually sorted out a way of going into Frimley Park Hospital to get it checked without having to go through A&#038;E (the last thing I needed was to sit in there for hours, the worst place to be when trying to avoid infections!)  So we sorted it out via our contacts with my Prof at Frimley (who’d have thought I’d have 2 Profs at the age of 27!)  It meant I spent most of the day there with Goose waiting to be checked and then waiting for a full blood count check to ensure I was ok before I was released at about 7pm!  Phew!  I was so worried I’d be kept in…but they were concerned about me and wanted to check me again on Monday to make sure I was ok.  So I got the weekend at home in our new house but was still not feeling too good to say the least.  I somehow managed to make it out for a meal on Saturday evening for Chris’s birthday with 15 of our friends.  I wasn’t feeling too good but I wanted to make the effort for Chris’s birthday and I managed better than I thought I would once I was out.  Anna &#038; Dan kindly drove us and left with me after the meal so Chris could go out and celebrate!  Laura came with us too and we snuck back to Anna &#038; Dan’s and watched X Factor on Sky Plus!  Chris went out with the boys and let his hair down, so to speak…so much so that Dave had to walk him home (he said he’s never walked a bloke home before!  Yeah right Dave!!) and he then came in at 2.50 am and amongst other things that drunken fools do, he fell down the stairs and slept on the floor in the lounge!!  Buy a 5 bedroom house and sleep of the floor in the lounge on the 2nd night living there!!  Hilarious!  Well it wasn’t at the time, when I’m in bed unable to walk thinking he’s broken his neck or something until I hear an “I’m ok, I’m ok!!”  Bless him, he came upstairs to tell me he loves me approximately 300 times, with a response from me of “Yes I love you too, goodnight, let’s go to sleep now!”  I think it’s good for him to release it all from time to time and what better time than his birthday!  He’s been so amazing and continued to work so hard whilst supporting and caring for me unconditionally over the past 6 months, I couldn’t possibly ask for more.  Some girlfriends I’m sure would be mad for the drunken incident but I can laugh about it, it’s hardly crime of the century and life’s too short to be in a mood with someone you love!  Get over it!</p>
<p>Anyway I’ve completely lost the point of this…again!  After that weekend that was mostly spent in bed, I don’t think I entered any other rooms in our amazing house! (I’ll post some photos when I can!)  On the Monday I had to go to Oxford to see the surgeon and the physio…all was good there, happy with progress, slow but steady, scar healing well.  In fact the surgeon was so excited, he made me peel the dressing off and he was going “Oooh it’s like opening a Christmas present!”  I wouldn’t like to spend Christmas at his house if there’s a pile of limbs with wounds to unwrap under the Christmas tree!  Then he examined the wound and was like “ooooh doesn’t it look lovely!!”  Erm, NO!  It’s a great big cut down my leg, lovely isn’t the word that springs to my mind!!  He’s been great though and that’s obviously just how the mind of a surgeon works!  I can’t understand it myself but I’m glad he loves it so much as he’s got the evil cancer out of my leg!  Anyway after the checks in Oxford I had to go back to Frimley for a check of my blood count again.  Whilst waiting in the waiting room in my wheelchair as it was too far to walk on my crutches I suddenly got really hot and dizzy and ended up passing out!  Oops!  Not the right thing to do when trying to convince them I’m ok to go home and don’t need to stay in!  They did a blood check and it turned out I was anaemic again and neutropenic.  I needed a 3 unit blood transfusion (not unusual for me!) and platelets transfusion and IV antibiotics to be safe.  Great, I thought, back to square one. Just the same as before.  I was so disappointed but had had a feeling it would happen in the run up to it.  I knew in my heart I wouldn’t be going home that night (hence the bag packed in the car!)  So that was that.  With no rooms available in the private ward, I was put into the haematology isolation ward.  A modern, clean separate room but I felt it had the feel of a mental asylum!  &#038; if that was my first impressions…how would I feel after days of not leaving it!!…well I was there until Friday and it wasn’t much fun at all.  I was so disappointed after being told it was so much less likely to happen on this chemo and yet it happened exactly the same again.  Not to the extent of intensive care or as bad as some of the times before but still bad enough.  Even when I don’t feel that bad it’s the fact that every time it happens my life is at risk.  &#038; my Frimley Prof told me that in black and white on Friday.  It can’t keep happening because it’s risking my life and they don’t want to lose me at this stage in the treatment after such success so far.  It’s such a balancing act to pump enough poison into me to kill the cancer but not too much to kill me.  That’s what I think a lot of people don’t understand.  Because I try to be positive when I see and speak to people and so do my family and friends and Chris, people think it’s all ok.  I’ve struggled with that recently, it seems the longer this goes on the more ‘normal’ it becomes for people and because they think I’m coping they seem to have changed their attitude and just think I’m ok and it’s nearly over.  Well I am ‘ok’ but what does being ok mean?!  Compared to before this when I had my life, I’m not ok at all!  Compared to the really awful times like intensive care and those first chemo sessions then yeah I’m great!  It’s all relative but what I think some people don’t seem to understand is that I never feel ‘good’, I feel crap every single day, whether physically, mentally or emotionally…or all 3!  With so much to contend with, I’d be insane if I was on top of the world!  &#038; just because we’ve had good news about the treatment, yeah it’s great, of course it is and I totally appreciate that and am pleased but I’m still going through it everyday and I’ve still got a long way to go with lots more chemo and hospital stays and learning to walk and use my leg again!  It’s not over until it’s over and I will fight it to the end and I will keep going and I will stay as positive as I can.  I sound like I think no-one understands and that’s not the case.  The people closest to me have been amazing and you know who you are.  &#038; so many people I don’t see much have been fantastic too.  It’s just some people I get the impression they don’t really know what I’m going through…and not just me but everyone around me.  I’m not going to start naming and shaming and I don’t even know exactly who I mean it’s just a feeling I get and Goose, Chris and Anna have said the same cos they know me best and they’re going through it with me.  They see the highs and the lows and the in betweens!  Especially Goose who spends every day with me and Chris every evening.  Anna texts or calls everyday and I love her for that, she’s a true Scamp just like me!</p>
<p>On Friday I have an appointment with Prof in Oxford so we’ll discuss my chemo plans then as I think something will have to change with me going neutropenic again when he thought it’d be much less likely.  Then it’s back in for chemo on Monday L Oh well!</p>
<p>Anyway I could go on and on and on and on!…but Costa’s trying to close and I’m just sitting here tapping away!  I’m sorry I promised this would be brief at the start but you should know with me that it never is!  I’ll try and write more soon if I can get to a coffee shop or if Sky pull their finger out and activate our Broadband soon!  IF not I’m back in for chemo on Monday so I’ll be online then…</p>
<p>Love to you all!  Thank you Jan (AKA Billy!) for being my number one faithful blogger!!  I hope you found a pink outfit, you should’ve asked me the pink queen, I could’ve sorted you one out!!</p>

		<p>The good news is, for those of you who don&#8217;t know&#8230;I had the appointment with Prof yesterday and he said that they haven&#8217;t had such a good response to the chemo in my type of tumour for a long time!  Which is excellent and puts me in the best response group for the clinical trial!  So it&#8217;s the best case scenario considering the circumstances.  It basically means (this is where it gets a bit confusing!) that the chemo goes on for the longest of the possibilities but it&#8217;s just maintenance chemo (i.e. to be sure) and so it&#8217;s much lighter than the heavy stuff I&#8217;ve been having.  So I&#8217;ll have up to 8 more sessions every 3 weeks, taking me to the end of February latest.  It&#8217;s a long time and I know I&#8217;ve still got a long way to go but at least this hideous 5 months is starting to seem worth it if it&#8217;s saved my life.  The chemo will only be a few days each time as opposed to the 5 full on days I was used to&#8230;and supposedly I&#8217;ll be much much less likely to go neutropenic and get ill in between cycles, so hopefully I won&#8217;t end up in Frimley Park Hospital in between.  If that&#8217;s the case then it&#8217;ll be a breeze compared to what I been going through!  Although of course I&#8217;ve still got the battle of my leg to contend with and the challenge of building it back up, learning to maenovre it and to walk again.  It&#8217;s still very hard work and extremely painful but I notice very very small progress and I just have to be thankful that the chemo&#8217;s been working and the op was success and I was able to keep my leg.</p>
<p>Here are some pics of what my leg now looks like to give you more an idea of what I&#8217;ve had done&#8230;</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-106" title="cy11" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/09/cy11-245x300.jpg" alt="cy11" width="245" height="300" /><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-108" title="cy2" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/09/cy2-245x300.jpg" alt="cy2" width="245" height="300" /></p>

<p>They removed the tumour from my femur (thigh bone) and the surrounding bone which was a total of 13 cm of bone above my knee aswell as a knee replacement and metal going below <span class="text_exposed_hide">&#8230;</span><span class="text_exposed_show">my knee into the tibia bone. So there&#8217;s a fair bit of metal in my leg now! It&#8217;s heavy and bloody painful learning to use my leg again but at least I&#8217;ve still got it and the tumour&#8217;s out&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Anyway I just wanted to share the good news with all my faithful bloggers!</span></p>

		<p>As promised, I&#8217;m back!  Sooner than last time!  It&#8217;s now 2 weeks since my op and I&#8217;ve been in this room for 2 weeks and 1 day!  Enough to drive anyone insane but I&#8217;m still with you!  Just about!  The poor old lady in the room next door to me doesn&#8217;t have a clue who she is or where she is!  She shouts and screams all night (which is great fun for me!) then sleeps all day!  She asks the nurses if she was here earlier when she&#8217;s been here for weeks.  I hobbled past on my crutches the other evening and she was trying to get me to go in and help her!  I think she thought I was a nurse!  That&#8217;d be interesting, a nurse in pyjamas who can&#8217;t walk!  I don&#8217;t think the NHS are that desperate yet!</p>
<p>Anyway I&#8217;ve continued to make slow but steady progress.  On Tuesday morning  I passed the stair test!  Which involved going up and down some practice stairs with just 3 steps on them.  Not quite the same as tackling the stairs at home but at least I&#8217;ve got the technique!  I&#8217;ve got faster on my crutches, although still have to have leg in the splint and is still hard work.  My &#8216;dog lead&#8217; is amazing!  Very clever little tool so I can pick my leg up myself to get on and off the bed.  One problem though&#8230;it&#8217;s blue.  BLUE?!!  I need a pink fluffy one!  Another problem&#8230;there&#8217;s no way it would fit around a St Bernard&#8217;s neck!  Oh well, guess my leg will have to be my only pet for the moment!  I&#8217;ve also got another new toy called a helping hand which looks like a litter picker!  It&#8217;s so I can pick this up and to help me get dressed myself!</p>
<p>Tomorrow morning I&#8217;ve got to go over to the other hospital (The Churchill, which is the cancer centre where I have my chemo) for my appointment with Prof, where we&#8217;ll find out the results from the lab and the plan for the next stages of chemo.  It&#8217;ll be really good to know what the next steps are as this is the first time since the start that I don&#8217;t have a plan to work towards.  Then after my appointment I get to go home!  YAY!  I have to be back on Monday for chemo which is rubbish but at least I get to go home for the weekend.  I&#8217;m going to go to my parents for the weekend as I think it&#8217;ll be easier to manage there and our house is just full of boxes at the moment anyway!  We&#8217;re hoping for next week for the house move but<em> </em>it&#8217;s still not confirmed yet.  So hopefully I&#8217;ll come out of chemo into the new house but who knows!  I just have to take everything one day at a time at the moment, as I have for the last 5 months.</p>
<p>Well that&#8217;s all for now&#8230;thanks to all my faithful bloggers, I love reading your comments!  I know lots of people are reading but not commenting&#8230;please leave a comment so I know who you are!! </p>

		<p>Here I am…I’m back!  Sorry I haven’t blogged for soooooooo long, I’ve been receiving lots of complaints!  I think I’ll start charging a fee to read it!!  I guess when I’ve been have bad times and low points I didn’t feel up to blogging and just got bored of talking about myself and my illness and droning on.  Cancer is lots of things…terrifying, shocking, exhausting, painful, life changing…but no-one ever tells you how BORING it is!!  All I have to talk about is my blood count and chemo regime and now surgery stories…I can’t wait to have my life back to have something else to talk about! (not that I’m ever short of things to talk about!!)</p>
<p>Anyway it hasn’t all been bad, I’ll give you a brief history of the last 6 weeks or so.  I finally battled through and made it to chemo 6, the last for a while.  Then…yes you guessed it I went neutropenic and had my usual stay in Frimley Park Hospital.  I was desperate to get to the end of that cos then I was free…well as free as I could be at least for a while!  I had from around 25th August til 8th September to myself!  I wanted to do as much as possible and be as ‘normal’ as possible so I got up everyday, tried to forget I had cancer, put my wig on and went and tried to remember what it was like to be a normal 27 (hate saying that!) year old girl.  So I did what any girl would (or should!) do…I shopped!  I saw friends and family, went out for dinner and went shopping.  I managed to fit in a trip to the theatre to High School Musical 2 with Laura!  No comments please…yes we were the only adults there without children but we were proud of it!  I went for a night away with Chris to the seaside in a lovely hotel near Mudeford.  True English style it was sooooo wet and windy that I had to hold on to my hair!  Literally!  I had a woolly hat to secure it on!  Scary getting so close to losing a £200 wig into the sea!  &#038; I had a mini spa break with Anna too, the place was disappointing (FYI don’t go to Grayshott Spa, it’s a rip off!) but we still had a lovely time and lots of laughs as usual!  It was also lovely to spend some time with my family not in hospital and to know that Goose had a break from being my full-time nurse, PA, waitress etc.!!!  When I saw my nieces after a while of not seeing them, one of them saw me and said “Oh you’re hair’s grown back!”…if only it was that quick!  I love their innocence…plus my wig must be convincing!  My sister and brother in law and nieces came to see me yesterday which was lovely.  That’s the first time the girls have seen me in hospital and the brought me lovely glittery pictures to cheer me up and to stop me getting scared in the night bless them!</p>
<p>So the 8th September came and back came being a cancer patient rather than anything else….at least that’s how it felt.  Back to hospital for tests on my heart and another MRI scan, more needles and not being able to find veins.  Then on the 9th I was admitted to the Nuffield Orthapedic Centre where I would have my surgery the next day.  That evening, on recommendation from one of the nurses, we got takeway!  Domino’s pizza…what better way to prepare for a major op?!  The next morning I was to get ready for surgery first thing and was taken down to theatre by 9am in my attractive hospital gown!  After yet another battle to find veins in my hands and arms and the anaesthetic was in and I was away!  4 hours later and I awoke in recovery.  All I wanted to know was that I still had my leg.  I certainly couldn’t feel it but luckily I could see my toes (my beautifully manicured toes!  Thanks Carrie!  They let me keep it on!)  I was in HDU (high dependency unit…recovery) for HOURS!  Dozing in and out of a drug induced sleep but also wondering where Chris and my parents were and when I would see them and when I would go back to the ward.  Hours and hours passed and eventually my dad found me after 6pm.  No-one had told them where I was or how I was or ait on!)  I was in HDU (high dependency unit…recovery) for HOURS!  Dozing in and out of a drug induced sleep but also wondering where Chris and my parents were and when I would see them and when I would go back to the ward.  Hours and hours passed and eventually my dad found me after 6pm.  No-one had told them where I was or how I was or anything.  Terrible.  So he found me and sat with me for a while. I was so thirsty and there was a beaker I’d been sipping water from through a straw.  I felt absolutely fine and then more suddenly than you could ever believe I felt sick…and was sick!  Very sick…all the water back up again but it tasted like poison…pure poison!  Anyway then I was fine again and after a while my dad went and got Goose and Chris.  I didn’t get back up to my room until nearly 9pm, having been gone 12 hours in all.  Not what I expected  at all!  I thought I’d be back by lunchtime!</p>
<p>Since then has been a long, hard, slow process of being bed bound and trying to make small steps of progress each day and trying to keep positive.   My physio was held back at first as I got a bowel infection.  Not a nice experience being bed bound and having a bowel infection when relying on bed pans…I’ll leave the rest to your imagination!  I really struggled mid week last week to stay positive.  I could never imagine walking again and I guess the reality of all of this hit me again.  After my few weeks of ‘normality’ and trying not to think about the op, it seemed to have suddenly happened and I was stuck in bed unable to move my leg.  It did (and still does) feel like someone has attached a lead weight to my leg.  It doesn’t feel like my leg.  It doesn’t move like my leg.  But I have to keep telling myself it IS my leg and I’m lucky to have kept it at all.  So with help from my mum and dad and Chris and a good long cry and talk with Anna when she came in, I picked myself up again and forced myself to focus on positives and improvements.  Each day saw small steps until my tummy felt better and I was able to leave the room for a few minutes into the corridor on my walking frame.  Then yesterday I walked on crutches for the first time!  It’s hard work and very painful but I did it!  I have to have my leg in a splint before I get up and put any weight on it and my muscles aren’t built up enough yet and my knee would probably give way without the support of the splint.  All this time I’ve been stuck in bed I’ve had a catheter in and then last night I had a visit from a big black man (a nurse!) saying he’d be along to take it out at 5am!  Why on earth it needed to be at 5am I don’t know, his explanation made no sense!  Anyway he left me until 6.15 am and along he came…it was good to get it out but that meant I had to walk to pee!  So with some help from a nurse this morning I managed to get the bathroom on my crutches and go to the toilet and wash in the bathroom rather than in bed.  First time in 12 days!  I’ve just done some more exercises with the physio, I wish someone had told me how hard it’d be and how painful.  She’s coming back later so I can do some walking and she’s bringing me a ‘dog lead’ for me to lift my leg with! I still can’t lift it myself so to get out of bed I have to have someone to lift my leg out for me.  So with this dog lead I should be able to learn how to lift my leg out myself!  Should be interesting! </p>
<p>Well that’s August and September as concise as I could make it…I hope that updates you.  I promise to try and blog more from now on…that’s if anyone’s still reading!  Who are my faithful blog checkers?!…</p>
