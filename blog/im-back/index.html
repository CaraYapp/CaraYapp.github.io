		<p>Well here I am back again in the land of the living&#8230;well almost!  Sorry to all of those of you who&#8217;ve been missing the blog, I&#8217;ve had lots of people messaging me very upset they can&#8217;t get their daily dose!  I&#8217;ve been thinking about it lots but I&#8217;ve basically had a really really rough 2 weeks which lots of you will now know.</p>
<p>Basically after the first chemo I became really exhausted after a while and was stuck in bed at home with no interest in anything.  Then I picked up a bit but ended up in A&#038;E neutropenic.  That&#8217;s basically when the chemo makes my blood count of white cells so low I have no immune system and if I pick up any sort of infection my body can&#8217;t fight it at all.  There&#8217;s something called neutrophylls in your blood and it&#8217;s when they go low and it can be very dangerous if untreated.  So I have to look out for certain symptoms at home, temperature being the main indication.  Anyway so I ended up in A&#038;E and to cut a long story short ended up staying in Frimley Park for nearly a week.  It was a nightmare.  I also went anaemic which is when your red cells (haemoglobin) goes really low so I had to have a blood transfusion.  I managed to get home for 2 days before having to go back into Oxford for chemo number 2.  </p>
<p>The 2nd round of chemo really took it out of me alot more and was really harrowing.  I basically just lay there the whole time, with no energy for tv or reading or talking or anything.  That&#8217;s right&#8230;ME&#8230;not talking!  THAT&#8217;S when you know I&#8217;m really ill!!  The sickness started much earlier and went on MUCH longer too.  I got home from that last Saturday but was just so so sick and confined to be all week being sick.  Too weak to even get up by myself to go to the toilet.  I was the worst I&#8217;ve been so far.  Then again, on Thursday I ended up in A&#038;E.  This time in an ambulance because I was too weak to go any other way!  I was carried down my stairs at home my the paramedics in this special chair.  God knows how they managed to carry me, I was concerned they might collapse and need another ambulance!!  Again I was neutropenic and much more so this time.  So another long story short and I&#8217;m still in Frimley Park now.  Luckily this time I&#8217;m much happier and more comfortable as I&#8217;m in the private ward.  Again I&#8217;ve had lots of drugs for the infection and went very anaemic and needed another blood transfusion on Sunday.  This time 3 units of blood and platelets separately too.  I&#8217;ve had a mouth infection and ridiculously sore mouth from the chemo so literally didn&#8217;t eat for weeks!  7 stone here I come!  It doesn&#8217;t sound so appealing now though anymore!  I&#8217;m improving alot and am hoping to get home tomorrow or if not Thursday so I can have at least a few days at home before I&#8217;m in for chemo number 3, which I&#8217;m dreading.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s the last few weeks in a nutshell.  The very short version!  I&#8217;m afraid there&#8217;s been a lot less funny stories to tell!  Although it&#8217;s just all so surreal what becomes normal.  Peeing and pooing into cardboard trays is just normal now!  OOh was quite bizarre being bathed in bed by a big black woman VERY vigorously cos I was too week to bath or shower!!  Luckily my mum was in there with me!  Very surreal though and a bit scary!!   &#038; you should see the disposable knickers you get given by the hospital!  They&#8217;re like fishnet stockings but knickers!!  But not in a good way!!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s much calmer in this ward and I haven&#8217;t had any oriental men demanding I pee or philipino cleaners!  They were in the ward I was in at Frimley last time.  They chattered away non stop but god knows what about! One of them was trying to tell me about a vegetable one morning but it was all a bit too confusing for both of us!</p>
<p>Well lots of detail has been missed the past few weeks but I&#8217;ve got to hold something back for my book or none of you will buy it!</p>
<p>My hair&#8217;s almost all gone now.  Not sure if I look like a baby or an old lady.  I feel like a cross between the 2 aswell!  I just want to be bald now really (well obviously not really but got no choice!) but I don&#8217;t want the trauma of shaving it so I&#8217;m just waiting for the last wispy bits to go.  It&#8217;s extremely attractive&#8230;.?!</p>
<p>Well I&#8217;ll try to keep up more with the writing now but you know if I disappear it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m too unwell to get on the computer.  I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll be seeing lots of you over the weekend if all goes well so I can make the most of my &#8216;good&#8217; days before going back to Oxford for chemo.</p>
<p>Happy reading.  Sorry this one&#8217;s a bit boring &#8211; just an update really!<br />
Lots of love<br />
