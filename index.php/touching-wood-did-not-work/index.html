		<p>Well I last wrote on here on Wednesday and everything was going pretty well&#8230;how things changed!  To cut a long story short I ended up feeling pretty rough on Thursday with a sore throat and feeling very faint and dizzy.  My hands and feet were worse and my mouth really bad.  It&#8217;s hard to know when to do something about it and in hindsight maybe we should&#8217;ve got me into hospital earlier but by the evening I was so tired I just wanted to sleep!  Goose was worried so had stayed while I&#8217;d fallen asleep (with Chris doing his Darth Vader impression very well!!)  then I woke up at 2 am and my throat had got alot worse and my temperature had shot up which is the warning sign of infection and having gone neutropenic so I had to go to A&amp;E yet again&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;by this point I was feeling really poorly and in A&amp;E was trembling and shaking and freezing but with a really high fever by now.  It was the usual nightmare in A&amp;E&#8230;they didn&#8217;t want to use the PICC line that I&#8217;ve got in my arm so they were trying to get veins to put in a canula but couldn&#8217;t get a vein&#8230;but still attempted over and over and over again stabbing me in every possible place!  Anyway I said this would be the short version&#8230;eventually they used the PICC line and took blood and got me on antibiotics&#8230;then decided I needed to go to intensive care and that they were going to put an arterial line in my wrist AND a central line into a vein in my neck.  I really didn&#8217;t like the sound of this but the very tall doctor was a bit like the BFG so I thought I&#8217;d trust him!  &amp; he assured me that it wouldn&#8217;t hurt and that once it was in people forget they&#8217;re there!  Well&#8230;the BFG lied!  I had to go up to recovery to have these things put in&#8230;the wrist one was bad enough but bearable&#8230;the neck line was not&#8230;it was unbearable.  I had to lie down with an oxygen mask on and a sterile drape over my face while the doctor poked and prodded and my god I was as close to hysterical as I have been!   I wasn&#8217;t allowed anyone in with me so this poor student nurse was put in charge of keeping me calm&#8230;hmmm poor girl!  I just could not stop crying and was shaking like mad and freezing cold but wasn&#8217;t allowed a blanket cos my temperature was so high!  He injected local anaesthetic into my neck which was painful enough in itself but then I could still feeling him poking around in there.  GROSS!  Anyway the stupid line is still in my neck now and is sooooo painful and uncomfortable it&#8217;s driving me insane.  I&#8217;m waiting for the doctors to come round today in the hope that they&#8217;ll say it can come out now.  To top that as well as soon as they&#8217;d finished putting the line in my neck which took a long time, the nurse springs on me that she&#8217;s going to put a catheter in.  The less said about the better I think!  Not pleasant at all though and I&#8217;m very glad that came out when I left intensive care.  Very weird though and quite fascinating that I didn&#8217;t even know when I was peeing!  Chris was very interested at looking at the bag and letting me know when I was peeing!  Remember there&#8217;s not much to do in an intensive care room!</p>
<p>I was in intensive care until Saturday evening.  It was not an enjoyable experience obviously but I improved very quickly after on Friday having lots of fluid, lots of drugs, 4 units of blood and 2 units of platelets pumped into me!  I&#8217;m glad now to be back on the parkside ward that I&#8217;ve ended up in the last 2 times.  If I have to be anywhere I&#8217;d choose here so I&#8217;m trying to remain positive.  I feel alot better in myself so am just trying to relax and be patient (something I&#8217;ve had to be the past 3 months!)  At the moment my priority is just to get this thing out of my neck!  &amp; hopefully I&#8217;ll be out in time to have a good few days at home before I&#8217;m back to Oxford next Monday 20th.  I should think I&#8217;ll leave here Wednesday at the earliest but I&#8217;ve been given no indication of that yet either.</p>
<p>&#8230;so for now it&#8217;s just days in hospital with magazines, colouring and playing Uno again!  Keep the messages coming to keep me busy!</p>
<p>Bye for now x</p>
<p>P.S. Thank you Bear (IT manager) for sorting out the spam filter.  There&#8217;s no random comments now, thank you it&#8217;s SO much better! x</p>

					<p>Oh Scamp that sounds soooooo awful that you had to go through all that, I can&#8217;t even imagine. </p>
<p>I remember when my Dad was in hospital after his op and he had a catheter and the colostomy bag, he kept showing me the colostomy bag (he can&#8217;t even remember doing that), it wasn&#8217;t very nice at all but we still laughed about it!! Thank God he didn&#8217;t have to keep it.  I remember finding it weird that the catheter was strapped to his leg!!!!</p>
<p>Well I&#8217;ve just got back from my exam, I think I did pretty well in it, I&#8217;m confident I&#8217;ve passed.  Will find out at the beginning of August.</p>
<p>Let me know when you are happy to see me (I haven&#8217;t had any swine flu symptoms and it&#8217;s been over 7 days since I&#8217;ve been in contact with The Swine)!!  But obviously I know its very important that you don&#8217;t get it so wont mind if you want me to stay away (boohoo boohoo!!) </p>
<p>Oh, I watched Angus on Sunday in the end on my own, I really liked it, glad Ollie didn&#8217;t watch it with me as he would have been making negative comments all the way through!!! haha!</p>
<p>Love you and miss you Scamp. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</p>
