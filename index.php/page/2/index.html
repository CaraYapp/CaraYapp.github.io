		<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Back again&#8230;I haven&#8217;t been writing as much recently as I haven&#8217;t been feeling as well and also because with so few comments I tended to think noone was reading anymore!  But I have recently heard of lots of people reading via other people so I guess I&#8217;ll assume someone&#8217;s reading this and keep writing!  Let me know if you are reading!  Even if you don&#8217;t want to write a public comment on here, you can always email me at <a href="mailto:cara_yapp@yahoo.co.uk">cara_yapp@yahoo.co.uk</a>&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m back on the cancer ward and I&#8217;ve almost come full circle.  It feels very strange as I&#8217;m in a bay of 4 beds, not in my usual separate room.  Although it&#8217;s not the same bay, my bed is in the same corner of the bay that it was for my very first chemo so I can&#8217;t help but think back&#8230;I can hear the all too familiar sound of some poor chap being violently sick and it brings back so many awful memories over the past 10 months&#8230;</p>
<p>Well, on Friday I had my usual scheduled appointment with Prof to review things and to have my usual pre chemo blood checks etc.  My picc line, however, decided to give up on me and would not flush and was blocked.  It was decided it would have to be taken out.  After an already emotional morning of mixed thoughts and feelings about everything, this did not help.  Then, on meeting with Prof and the nurses I got very upset and couldn&#8217;t really explain why.  It&#8217;s just the  sheer exhaustion and pure emotion that comes from nearly a year of such a gruelling treatment regime&#8230;and also all the worries, concerns and anxieties that come when you&#8217;re thinking about getting your life back.  I also haven&#8217;t been feeling as well since my last chemo, nothing major compared to previous episodes but just not feeling right.  Basically Prof said I&#8217;m physically and emotionally exhausted from it all and it&#8217;s surprising that I&#8217;ve come this far and lasted this long.  He also said the way I&#8217;ve coped physically with the treatment I&#8217;ve had has been like an 18 year old!  I was very happy with that!  Shame my body doesn&#8217;t LOOK like an 18 year old&#8217;s!  Especially not with all the weight I&#8217;ve put on from the steroids and the immobility post surgery.   Anyway so basically he said maybe it&#8217;s time to call it a day.  I really didn&#8217;t know what to say, not knowing how I feel and having such mixed feelings about it.  It&#8217;s so hard when nobody knows what&#8217;s best and noone can make the decision but me.  There&#8217;s no evidence to suggest that prolonging the maintenance chemo I&#8217;m on at the moment will have any benefit.  Basically nobody knows what&#8217;s best.  But he did say having or not having one extra will not make any difference and the benefit won&#8217;t outway the damage it&#8217;s doing to me so he said we&#8217;d make a deal and I&#8217;d do this one more and this will be my last one.  Just wanting to be told what to do, I agreed with very mixed feelings and very emotional&#8230;</p>
<p>So here I am waiting for my last chemo to begin.  After sitting and waiting for 7 hours I was told at about 7 pm this evening that I wouldn&#8217;t start until tomorrow!  It&#8217;s a long story but I&#8217;m just being patient and being a good girl and so what if I&#8217;ll be in an extra night, I&#8217;ve done well over 100 nights in hospital in the past 10 months so I can do a few more!  &amp; before the chemo starts someone&#8217;s got to manage to get a canula into me now that my picc line&#8217;s gone!  &amp; my veins are NOT easy to find!</p>
<p>Anyway I had a lovely weekend as I took Chris away on a surprise weekend in the Cotswolds for 2 nights and then to a lovely hotel nearer to Oxford.  We did lots of fun things&#8230;dinners, lunches&#8230;not just eating though&#8230;cinema, a maze, a model village, the zoo, shopping (sorry Chris!) and lots of relaxing and walking in the pretty villages.  My leg&#8217;s paying for it now (well I am!) as I&#8217;ve walked so much, it&#8217;s really painful again now.  Good job I&#8217;m being forced to rest in hospital now.  I&#8217;ve come to realise the last few days that I&#8217;ve actually just got use to being in constant pain and I can&#8217;t remember what it&#8217;s like not to be in pain.  Since surgery, I literally have been in pain non stop.  &amp; that&#8217;s draining in itself but I count it as the least of my worries.  I still stand by what I&#8217;ve said before, that I&#8217;m so lucky to have kept my leg so no matter how painful or frustrating my leg is, I try not to complain as I keep myself in check thinking of those not as fortunate at me.  In fact I&#8217;m talking to a guy at the moment on facebook who I&#8217;ve got in contact with as he also had Ewing&#8217;s Sarcoma and unfortunately had to have his leg amputated.  I find it really helps me to talk to other people in similar situations as me, to compare notes so to speak!  I&#8217;ve also this evening met a guy on the ward who also has Ewing&#8217;s Sarcoma but not in the bone, in the soft tissue around his stomach.  It&#8217;s crazy that it&#8217;s something so so rare and I&#8217;ve spoken to 2 young guys with it within a few hours!  I also met another guy who had a similar cancer to me in a similar place and had the same surgery.  We&#8217;d been talking online and we met a few weeks ago at a new Sarcoma Support Group being run by the Macmillan Nurses at the hospital.  He finished his chemo in September and it was really good to meet him and see how well he&#8217;s doing and again to chat about our experiences.  It makes you realise, even if you have the same or similar things, just how different everyone&#8217;s experience is.  It&#8217;s a great reminder that you&#8217;re not the only one going through it aswell, which it can sometimes feel like&#8230;also a reminder to count your blessings and always to think about why I&#8217;m lucky not why I&#8217;m unlucky. Not always easy but hey&#8230;</p>
<p>Anyway so that&#8217;s my latest&#8230;I know you&#8217;ll all be reading thinking, great, yippee, wahoo, last chemo!  Unfortunately I seem to be yet to feel that way.  To be honest my head feels pretty messed up and I don&#8217;t understand a lot of what I&#8217;m feeling right now.  It&#8217;s as if I don&#8217;t want to stop chemo which is very backwards!  It&#8217;s partly the fear of stopping and not having treatment any longer, which fuels the fear of the cancer recurring.  Also it&#8217;s the fact that for such a long time I&#8217;ve lived by such a strict cycle and that will stop.  I&#8217;ve also forged some really strong relationships with so many of the staff, I feel sad to lose them.  All I&#8217;ve known for so long is cancer and all I&#8217;ve been is a cancer patient and that will suddenly stop.  I feel this pressure (not from anyone, just myself!) to be able to pick up where I left off before this evil disease struck, which is physically impossible to do.  I feel lost.  I feel like I don&#8217;t know who I am anymore even though all my friends and  loved ones say I haven&#8217;t changed a bit and am still the same.  I feel like I&#8217;ve changed though, I couldn&#8217;t tell you how or explain what I mean exactly but I know I&#8217;ll never be the same person I was before.  I feel alot has been taken away from me.  Any innocence I had about life has gone.  I&#8217;ve seen and felt the worst I could imagine and I find it alot harder to daydream now and imagine my life being mapped out like a fairytale!  I know all this is just real life and that comes with growing up anyway&#8230;but it&#8217;s usually a lot more gradual than having a bombshell like cancer dropped on you at 26!  Physically I feel like I&#8217;ve been chucked on a rollercoaster which hasn&#8217;t stopped for nearly a year, making me sick, ripping out my hair, making a huge scar on my leg, removing my bone and replacing it with metal, screwing with every emotion I have inside and now the rollercoaster&#8217;s about to chuck me out and drop me from a great height, ready to face the world again?!  I think alot of my anxieties also stem from the feeling that I&#8217;ve been a patient and been cared for and treated for so long that all I&#8217;ve had to do is lie back and take it and be patient and put up with all the illness, sickness, waiting, etc. etc. I say &#8216;all&#8217; but I don&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s been easy as that would be lying!  It&#8217;s been the hardest thing I&#8217;ve ever done without a doubt.  But I&#8217;ve had unbelievably amazing support and care and love through it all.  But once all this is &#8216;over&#8217; all the things I&#8217;ve got to do, like getting my independence back and going back to work etc. are things that I&#8217;VE got to do myself and noone can do them for me.  I know I&#8217;ll still have the love and support etc. but it&#8217;s me that&#8217;s got to get out there, get my confidence back and build my life back up again.  Anyway one step at a time.  I&#8217;m just a typical girl, thinking too much as usual!  These are all normal things to feel though according to the experts!  &amp; from books etc. that I&#8217;ve been reading, there are a lot of cancer survivors out there who have or or are feeling the same things.  I was reading a girl&#8217;s story earlier and she was saying how the doctors and nurses support you towards the goal of the day when they tell you that you don&#8217;t need to come back anymore. Obviously that&#8217;s a very important day but it doesn&#8217;t all end there for us, you don&#8217;t just get over it overnight.  I&#8217;m still left physically and emotionally scarred from all I&#8217;ve been through and have still got a lot of healing and recovering to do yet.  I&#8217;ve been feeling a really strange feeling of guilt since it was decided I&#8217;d be stopping after this chemo.  I can&#8217;t really put my finger on why.  Maybe because I feel I&#8217;m letting everyone down by stoppping?  Maybe letting myself down?  Giving up?  Strangely I feel guilt that I&#8217;ve got holidays and nice things planned when I feel like I should be in hospital being treated.  I don&#8217;t know why I feel that!  I&#8217;ve never in my life felt so many things that are so alien to me, it&#8217;s bizarre!  Anyway Prof assured me that I&#8217;m in no way giving up, I&#8217;ve in no way let ANYONE down and there&#8217;s no way I could have taken anymore treatment that I have.  The toxicity of the first 6 chemo was the most intense and most toxic that they will give and they couldn&#8217;t possibly have given me anymore.  So I think maybe I should stop giving myself a hard time and realise how well I&#8217;ve done, but I don&#8217;t feel like that yet.  Maybe it will come in time.  I&#8217;m always too hard on myself though in all things in life so why would I change now?!</p>
<p>Right I&#8217;m going to shut up now as this has probably been a bit heavy!  I don&#8217;t want you thinking I&#8217;m really struggling and really depressed because I&#8217;m not!  I&#8217;m still my cheerful self most of the time and if you saw me you probably wouldn&#8217;t sense any difference.  But it&#8217;s the people who REALLY know me who there&#8217;s no hiding what&#8217;s going on inside from.  I&#8217;m just confused and muddled at the moment but in this rollercoaster ride, I don&#8217;t dwell too much on how I&#8217;m feeling because it can change SO much from day to day so I&#8217;ll just take one step at a time and each day as it comes.  That&#8217;s all I can do.  I just think that the difficulty of the time after the treatment ends can be underestimated and I don&#8217;t want people to take the view of  &#8216;oh great it&#8217;s all finished, she&#8217;s ok now&#8217; &#8230;it&#8217;s really not as simple as that and anyone who thinks it is should count themselves VERY lucky to be in the fortunate position of being that innocently naive.</p>
<p>Oh just one quick story to share with you&#8230;today I met officially THE most stupid person I must&#8217;ve ever met!  I went down to the shop in the hospital&#8230;the specialist CANCER hospital.  I didn&#8217;t have my wig on and I was limping quite badly as my leg&#8217;s particularly painful today.  I was stocking up on a big pile of essential educational reading&#8230;Heat, OK, Closer&#8230;..very upmarked publications!  I went to the counter to pay</p>
<p>STUPID CHECKOUT GIRL: &#8220;What have you done?&#8221;</p>
<p>BALD, LIMPING CANCER PATIENT (ME!): &#8220;Sorry?&#8221;</p>
<p>STUPID CHECKOUT GIRL: &#8220;What have you done? You&#8217;re limping&#8221; (as if I didn&#8217;t KNOW I was limping!)</p>
<p>ME: &#8220;Yeah I am&#8221;  (hoping she&#8217;d sense me not wanting to talk about it!)</p>
<p>STUPID CHECKOUT GIRL: &#8220;So, what have you done then?&#8221; (she&#8217;s clearly not going to give up or get the hint!)</p>
<p>ME: &#8220;I haven&#8217;t DONE anything.  I&#8217;ve got cancer in my leg&#8221;</p>
<p>STUPID CHECKOUT GIRL: <em>Tone =  pure genuine shock </em>&#8220;OH!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8230;OH&#8230;MY&#8230;GOD&#8230;what on EARTH is between her ears because it&#8217;s certainly not a brain?!  Does she even know what building she&#8217;s working in?!  I don&#8217;t expect she know that oncology means cancer but it&#8217;s even called the Cancer &amp; Haemotology Centre.  She probably just thinks she&#8217;s working in a shopping centre and sometimes vaguely wonders why there&#8217;s lots of bald people, why the only other shop there is a wig shop and why there&#8217;s lots of wheelchairs and sometimes ambulances outside?!  Strange shopping centre!  The funny thing was though that she probably started to feel sorry for me when I told her, but actually I think I felt alot more sorry for her!  I mean, I can recover from cancer, but it&#8217;s not as if she can have a brain transplant!!!!  Classic!  If by any chance you&#8217;re reading this (on the off chance that you can actually read!) apologies for referring to you as &#8216;stupid checkout girl&#8217; but I didn&#8217;t catch your name as you were interogating me&#8230;</p>
<p>At least I can laugh about it!  Right then I promise to push off now!  Comment me or email me so I know someone&#8217;s reading!  Or I might stop writing!  Any publishers want to publish my story yet?!  Once again I won&#8217;t read this back, I&#8217;ll just hit the publish button.  I&#8217;ve never ever read back what I&#8217;ve written on here because I feel that if I did I would think twice about posting it and I&#8217;d start to edit&#8230;sometimes this might be a good thing, but the whole point of it is that it&#8217;s my chance to get out all my thoughts and feelings and to empty my head (I wish my head was half as empty as checkout girl&#8217;s!) so I hope you don&#8217;t mind reading my splurge of random thoughts!</p>
<p>Night night, don&#8217;t let the bed bugs bite!</p>

		<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll start AGAIN by saying sorry it&#8217;s been so long&#8230;I always seem to have to say that everytime I come on so I obviously need to make more of an effort to write more often!  I&#8217;m now on chemo 12&#8230;soon I can say 12 down, 2 to go.  It feels more like 112 than 12 but hey ho!  It never fails to astound me how quickly the chemo hits me.  I didn&#8217;t get started until after 9 last night (don&#8217;t you just love hospitals!) but so quickly I felt the effects.  It&#8217;s like&#8230;.well I really don&#8217;t know how to describe what it&#8217;s like as it&#8217;s certainly like nothing else I could compare it to.  I guess it is just like having poison put into your veins.  Which is what it is really!  Anyway I&#8217;m on track to be Prof&#8217;s first adult to make it to the full 14!  I&#8217;m determined!  I&#8217;m also scared to get too excited about finishing though as you never know what&#8217;s around the corner&#8230;but that is life and life is for living &amp; I&#8217;m so excited about living my life after being so close to losing it.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a busy time with my dad and nana still not being very well and with me recovering from chemo again, getting the balancing act right with exercising &amp; resting my leg to manage the pain but still made progress.  My poor mum (Goose!) &#8230;looking after and worrying about  her husband, daughter and mum.  &amp; she just keeps going.  I&#8217;ve been told a few times recently that I&#8217;m wonder woman for going through what I&#8217;ve had but I think Goose is Wonder Woman!!  Anwayay the good news is as of a week ago I started driving again!!  WATCH OUT!  I should have warned you all sooner!  &amp; I&#8217;ve now done a whole week of walking without my trusty crutch to help me!  I don&#8217;t really know what changed&#8230;I&#8217;d been thinking about driving for a while but the snow stopped that in it&#8217;s tracks for a long time!  Literally!  No one could get on or off our driveway or down our Close without getting stuck, so the sofa was fine for me!!  So as soon as it was gone and seemed safe (in terms of weather anyway, not sure about my leg!) I just did it!  &amp; loved it!  It was like being 17 again and passing my test and feeling that unbelievable freedom and independence you&#8217;ve dreamed of for so long.  But also very bizarre!  I felt like I was a naughty kid stealing a car or something!  But don&#8217;t worry, it was MY car I was driving!  &amp; as for the walking, the first time I drove I got out my car and got my crutch and it just felt wrong to do that!  So the next day I tried without and I haven&#8217;t looked back.  I think it&#8217;s more psychological than anything &#8211; having the confidence to give it ago and to limp around without the protection of the crutch.  It becomes your tool to walk and balance for so long and I also think it becomes a warning sign for other people and you feel more protected, especially in busy places if people know there&#8217;s something wrong.  Mind you, most people are so absorbed in their own little worlds, they don&#8217;t even notice and don&#8217;t take any precautions to be cautious around you!  Anyway I&#8217;m feeling much MUCH more like myself than I have for a long LONG time.  I think it&#8217;s because I feel like I&#8217;m taking some control over things and taking small steps towards freedom.  I&#8217;m also doing weight watchers, as I&#8217;ve put on so much weight.  This is partly due to me being so immobile since surgery, so without being able to barely walk you can hardly exercise!  But now I&#8217;m finding more gentle exercises that I can do so am trying my best..  It&#8217;s also due to all the medication I&#8217;m on, especially the steroids which are horrible things.  The docs and nurses tell me it&#8217;s to be expected and not to worry about, but all I&#8217;m doing is making more sensible choices and being healthier and cutting down on stuff.   &amp; I feel so much better for doing it&#8230;again I think it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m taking control and looking to the future.  I had too many months with the attitude &#8220;I&#8217;ve got cancer, I can eat what I like!&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also booked 4 holidays!!!  I&#8217;m due to finish chemo in March, all being well.  So on 6th April I&#8217;m off to La Gomera which is the 2nd smallest of the canary islands.  I&#8217;m going with Chris, my mum and dad, my sister &amp; brother in law, my 3 nieces and my brother will come for part of the time.  I CAN&#8217;T WAIT!!  SO EXCITING!  Then in May I&#8217;m going to Portugal with a couple of friends, Gemma &amp; Lou.  Back to Portugal again in June with Chris, Ollie &amp; Laura.  Then BARBADOS in August for 2 weeks with Chris for my friend&#8217;s wedding!  SO EXCITING!  I&#8217;ve also arranged a surprise weekend for Chris and I for Valentine&#8217;s weekend&#8230;I can say no more!  &amp; I&#8217;ve got a few spa trips to fit in too.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also bursting to arrange my &#8216;chemo&#8217;s over&#8217; party but it&#8217;s proving difficult to find a date, with all this holidays and with wanting so many people to be able to make it I&#8217;m a bit baffled at the moment&#8230;but watch this space!</p>
<p>The quote in the title &#8216;I am somebody with cancer and I am somebody without cancer&#8217; is from a book I&#8217;ve started to read which is a collection of stories from cancer survivors.  The first story I opened the book to is by a girl who had Ewing&#8217;s Sarcoma&#8230;my cancer.  &amp; this was a quote from her.  It&#8217;s so so true and that&#8217;s why I love reading things like this because I can relate to them so much.  Earlier on last year, I read Lance Armstrong&#8217;s &#8216;It&#8217;s Not About The Bike&#8217; which was about his fight with cancer and survival against all odds.  It&#8217;s a great read and I recommend it.  Although while I read things like that I&#8217;m like a nodding dog, nod nod nod as I relate to so much of it!  What that quote means to me is that although the cancer&#8217;s &#8216;gone&#8217;&#8230;or they think it has&#8230;you don&#8217;t just stop being someone with cancer just like that.  In fact you never do.  It&#8217;s not something that just goes away.  There&#8217;s the physical implications but also, which is too often overlooked, there&#8217;s the psychological and emotional aspects which are huge and everlasting.  I had yet another echo cardiogram on my heart on Friday to check that the chemo isn&#8217;t damaging my heart&#8230;luckily all is ok there.  Then yesterday I had a CT scan on my chest to check my lungs.  If the cancer comes back it is highly likely to return in my lungs.  Something which petrifies me but &#8216;I can&#8217;t ruin today worrying about tomorrow&#8217;.  This is another quote from another survivor in my book.  Again, very true and something I&#8217;ve had to teach myself with the help and support from my amazing support network.  Chris isn&#8217;t a worrier and is great at putting things like that into perspective.  &amp; my dad has always taught me to live for today and not to worry too much about the future. Obviously you can plan for the future to a certain extent, but you never know what&#8217;s around the corner.  Another quote: &#8216;Life is a journey, not a guided tour&#8217;.  Of course it&#8217;s a worry and sometimes I can&#8217;t help but worry but I have got much better at managing it.  It wasn&#8217;t until I was lying in the CT scanner yesterday that I allowed myself to really think about why I was in there.  &amp; having been diagnosed once when it was soooooooo unlikely, the likelihood now is much higher and my mind can&#8217;t help but go for a wander and run away with itself thinking what if I&#8217;m told it&#8217;s back in my lungs.  But luckily my amazing team here were up seeing me on the ward within about an hour and waiting for the scans to be available on the system.  &amp; they were able to tell me the scan looks fine.  PHEW!!  If it does happen it&#8217;s something we&#8217;ll have to face if and when it happens.  Until then I have to look forward and I&#8217;d rather assume it won&#8217;t happen than assume it will.  Chris says if I cant beat it once I can beat it again.  Hopefully it won&#8217;t ever come to that&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m hoping to make it to a new Sarcoma Support Group here in Oxford next week where it should be a great opportunity to meet other Sarcoma patients.  I&#8217;ve been talking online to a guy just a year older than me who had a similar bone cancer to me.  We&#8217;re hoping to meet up there too.  I&#8217;ve also booked on for a few things at a cancer support centre here.  I&#8217;ve never been able to make it there before as I&#8217;ve never been well enough but I&#8217;m glad I have now as they&#8217;ve been really helpful.  It&#8217;s called the Maggie&#8217;s Centre.  There&#8217;s a few around the country but this is the nearest one for the south.  They&#8217;re currently operating out of a tiny temporary building miles across the many car parks from the cancer centre where I&#8217;m treated.  They&#8217;re currently fundraising to open a new building opposite the main hospital &amp; cancer centre which would be amazing as they&#8217;re such a great support resource but so hard to access at the moment.  SO I&#8217;m hoping to do some fundraising for them too.  There&#8217;s just sooooo many worthy charities, it&#8217;s hard to know who to choose.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to plan to do Race for Life this year.  There&#8217;s not going to be much &#8216;racing&#8217; from me as obviously I&#8217;ll have to walk but I&#8217;m hoping my leg will be strong enough by then.  I&#8217;m determined to do it and to get TEAM SCAMP bigger than I could ever imagine so if you&#8217;re female (sorry boys, girls only!) and are up for joining us and wearing lots of PINK and celebrating with a picnic afterwards and raising as much money for Cancer Research as we can, then email me at <a href="mailto:cara_yapp@yahoo.co.uk">cara_yapp@yahoo.co.uk</a> and I&#8217;ll let you know the details.  The more the merrier!  Don&#8217;t be shy if I haven&#8217;t seen you for years&#8230;if you&#8217;re reading you must be interested so I&#8217;d love to hear from you. &amp; friends/family would be welcome to become Team Scampers too!  If anyone else is reading (as I keep hearing of all sorts of people in all sorts of ways!) but you still don&#8217;t feel you want to comment on here, feel free to email me too!</p>
<p>Right, well I&#8217;m pretty pooped from the chemo.  I hope everyone reading is well &amp; I&#8217;ll try and come back sooner next time!</p>

		<p>Well here I am, back in my usual room 20 in the Churchill hospital in Oxford with chemo running through my veins and paying an extortionate amount for the internet!  So I&#8217;m making the most of it by updating you&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll starting my saying Happy New Year to all you all though and wishing you a HEALTHY 2010&#8230;I won&#8217;t say happy as health should bring you happiness and I won&#8217;t say wealthy as wealth can&#8217;t buy you health.  So just look after yourselves and enjoy each day for what it is and make the most of what and who you&#8217;ve got.  I know you never think things will happen to you or those close to you but you really don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s around the corner.  You can&#8217;t live in fear of that but you can live for now and enjoy it with those you love&#8230;</p>
<p>Well the dreaded 4th January started when I went to see my surgeon yesterday morning.  It was already planned but good timing as for just over a week now I&#8217;ve been have agonising shooting pains down my leg, below my knee and down to my ankle.  It&#8217;s made it really hard to walk and I&#8217;d gone from no crutches round the house back to using 2 of them mostly just to be able to get around.  Disheartening and also scary as I got in a bit of a state, was freaking out a bit about what it might be&#8230;my mind was running away with itself with thoughts and fears of what if the cancer&#8217;s come back, how will I tell everyone, what will happen, what if I have to lose my leg.  Anyway I went to Oxford last Wednesday for an appointment with Prof so I told him.  He checked my leg over and was concerned it could be an infection in my leg in which case it&#8217;d need treating with antiobiotics quickly.  He said he was probably being over cautious but would rather tule that out first and also get scans done to check the prosthesis is all ok.  So he sent me over to the Nuffield where I had my surgery for an ultrasound and some xrays.  The doctor seemed a bit vague, and having never met him before I was a bit unsure and found it hard to trust him totally.  That surprised me as I&#8217;ve always been very trusting of people but it&#8217;s a bit different when your life, or at least your leg, could be at stake!  Anyway he said he saw no obvious signs of anything but would send a report to Prof.  So I left feeling not very reassured and still worry and concerned.  It just brought it all back to me what it was like before my cancer was diagnosed, when I initially had a sore knee.  Everyone was telling me I&#8217;d probably just pulled something whilst running or during aerobics.  But the trouble walking and the sleepless nights due to the pain had come back and no matter how many times Chris said he&#8217;s sure there&#8217;s nothing to worry about and I&#8217;ve probably just strained it by putting extra pressure on other parts of my leg due to my problematic (bionic!) knee, I still had this horrible niggling feeling.  After all I&#8217;d been there once already, I didn&#8217;t really feel like starting that hideous journey all over again before this one is even over. </p>
<p>Anyway so Prof had not received a report and was just glad I was seeing my surgeon, Max Gibbons, as he&#8217;s the expert in this area and he&#8217;s the best person to check it over.  I agreed and was so glad the appointment was already set for Monday.  I just had to get through New Year&#8217;s Eve and try to enjoy that and the remaining few days before life as a cancer patient started again. </p>
<p>New Year&#8217;s Eve was quite emotional for me.  We&#8217;ve been saying for so long how we wanted to see the back of 2009 and 2010 had to be better but as it drew closer, it was just dawning on me that a change of the year won&#8217;t change anything.  The situation is what it is and it&#8217;s not changing for a while.  Saying that thought I can start to see and think about the light at the end of the tunnel and let&#8217;s hope overall 2010 is a better year than 2009 for all of us.  I think it was with my dad and nana being ill too, I just had so much worry inside me but at the same time I was desperately trying to stay strong for me but also for everyone else&#8230; </p>
<p>So New Year&#8217;s Eve turned out to be a very grown up and sophisticated evening&#8230;?!  Well maybe it started out that way!  We did a dinner party for 10 of us in the end, all friends, all couples.  It was all a bit up in the air until the last minute as people had other things going on so the number we were expecting went up and down like a yo yo.  I wasn&#8217;t feeling too goo emotionally or physically and needed to rest my leg, so Chris was the hero and did all the shopping and most of the cooking.  I did help though!  I tried to pick myself up and get into the spirit of things but I just didn&#8217;t feel like celebrating the end of such an awful year, or starting a new year in such a rubbish way.  My leg was agony too and I was trying to put on a brave face, not too succesfully I don&#8217;t think!  Anyway my &#8216;happy act&#8217; didn&#8217;t last too long, patehtic really and the tears came and went early on in the evening.  &amp; my spirits were lifted by my lovely Chris, my lovely friends and a Baileys coffee followed by lots of champagne!  Mostly pink of course!  It didn&#8217;t stay such a grown up, sophisticated evening as we ended up playing suck and blow with a card that came out of a cracker!  It&#8217;s NOT as bad as it sounds.  Has anyone seen the film Clueless then you&#8217;ll know?!</p>
<p>We had a lazy New Year&#8217;s Day to recover along with Ollie and Laura who were a HUGE help tidying up and cleaning the mess from the night before.  THANK YOU GUYS!  Then we played Mario 4 player on the Wii, soooooooooooo good and wasted the day and our hangovers away!</p>
<p>The weekend was a lazy one too, resting my leg as much as possible but I got to see J again &#8211; 3 times in 2 weeks!  Lovely as she now lives in Colchester but we used to live together in Southampton.  &amp; I spent the afternoon with Anna which perked me up as usual.  In the evening we went to our neighbour&#8217;s house who invited everyone from our Close over for drinks.  We were a bit nervous about going as we&#8217;re &#8216;the new kids on the close!&#8217; and I was also nervous about having to explain to everyone about my illness.  It was a lovely evening though and we got to meet most of our new neighbours and they were all lovely.  The couple who&#8217;s house we went to have just refurbished their house, including knocking down lots of walls and making it more open plan&#8230;it&#8217;s gorgeous&#8230;guess what the topic of conversation with Chris was walking home&#8230;&amp;getting ready for bed&#8230;.&amp; in bed&#8230;&amp; the next morning!!  Most sentences started with &#8220;We could&#8230;.&#8221;  I think a can of worms has been opened!</p>
<p>Sunday I was as lazy as possible but we did have to take our Christmas trees down (well done Chris!) <img src="../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":-(" class="wp-smiley" />  Very sad, the house feels empty!  But then my brother came down from London to see me and my sister, brother in law and the 3 girls came over and so did my mum.  So a bit of a full house but only for a little while and it was great to see everyone before the dreading 4th Jan &amp; chemo number 11 arrived.</p>
<p>So back to yesterday and my visit to the surgeon.  He was amazing.  &amp; having already got huge trust in him considering he&#8217;s one of the people I owe my life to as he managed to remove the cancer and save my leg&#8230;.I decribed the pain to him and he went straight to a certain point on my leg and said &#8220;I&#8217;m going to push here and I think it&#8217;s going to hurt!&#8221;  and he did&#8230;and it did!  It was the same pain I&#8217;ve been having.  He continued &#8220;It&#8217;s the commone peroneal nerve&#8221; &#8230;.I must&#8217;ve asked him 4 times during the course of the appointment to repeat the name of it and there were 4 of us in there but 5 minutes later we sat down with a coffee and none of us knew the name!  We came up with all sorts&#8230;commoperitional, compotional, well I won&#8217;t go on, they were all totally wrong and ridiculous!  Anyway it turns out it&#8217;s a nerve that runs down your leg all the way down to the ankle/foot which explains why the pains are going right down there.  He said it&#8217;s common to have this problem after major surgery like I&#8217;ve had and that hopefully it&#8217;ll go away by itself.  This could be soon or could take a long time.  If it persists for a long time they may have to do an operation to fix the problem.  As there&#8217;s some fluid and swelling I&#8217;m supposed to be elevating my leg too.  I practically folded myself in half on the hospital bed last night!</p>
<p>Anyway I&#8217;m just glad I know what it is.  There&#8217;s nothing worse than not knowing.  &amp; I was glad to hear it&#8217;s not an infection, it&#8217;s not cancer, it&#8217;s not something wrong with my new prosthesis, but also glad not to be fobbed off with &#8216;you&#8217;ve strained it, or pulled something&#8217;.  Granted I didn&#8217;t understand all of what he was saying but at least he understands and knows what he&#8217;s doing!  &amp; google has helped me out a bit since!  Although that can be dangerous and scary so no more of that for me!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m back on the chemo now and eventually started yesterday evening.  They had some trouble with my Picc line and then had trouble trying to get needles in for canulas elsewhere.  My veins are hiding more than ever&#8230;some things never change!  Eventually they got the Picc line working and I&#8217;m back with my trusty friend, my drip!  Attached 24/7, seems like I&#8217;ve never been away! </p>
<p>I&#8217;m exhausted today from the chemo and I didn&#8217;t get much sleep being back in here and with my chemo pump beeping every 2 minutes!  I&#8217;m surprised I&#8217;ve managed to write this much, I bet you wish I hadn&#8217;t!  I&#8217;m now in touch with a guy about my age who had the same thing as me and was treated in the same place.  He&#8217;s finished his chemo but it&#8217;s good to talk to someone (on facebook!) who&#8217;s been through such a similar experience.  I think it really helps me, especially as he&#8217;s come out the other side and is getting on with his life&#8230;.</p>
<p>Right enough babbling from me.  I hope 2010 is good for you all so far and going back to work hasn&#8217;t been too gruelling.  I know it seems horrible to go back to work but just remember I (and lots of others) would be doing it if we could!  Remind me of that when I&#8217;ve gone back to work and I&#8217;m moaning!!</p>
<p>Take care xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ll be glad to see the end of 2009 and having been looking forward to New Year for that reason only&#8230;(I&#8217;m not a fan of New Year&#8217;s Eve generally!)  But now that it&#8217;s here it&#8217;s dawned on me that just because at midnight it becomes a new year, it doesn&#8217;t mean everything&#8217;s going to miraculously get better overnight.  Unfortunately.  Anyway I won&#8217;t be all doom and gloom&#8230;here&#8217;s hoping for a better 2010 on the whole.  I won&#8217;t say it can&#8217;t get any worse because it could and I&#8217;m not going to tempt fate.  I&#8217;m just feeling a bit low and fed up.  The peaceful, relaxing Christmas we were hoping for unfortunately did not happen.  I won&#8217;t go into too much detail on here but my dad ended up in hospital and got out on Christmas Eve but is still not well and is going for more tests next week.  As my dad was discharged, my Nana went into hospital and sadly had to spend Christmas there and is still there.  It seems the year wants to end on a low note for my family&#8230;a rubbish end to a rubbish year.  My sister even had someone skid into the wall in front of her house and flatten it &amp; crash into their 2 cars on the driveway!  Thank goodness noone was hurt, but when does that ever happen?!  It&#8217;s just one thing after another at the moment.  I&#8217;m not feeling all that great and am having trouble with my leg.  A trip to Oxford for an appointment yesterday led to more scans and just brought it all back to me that I&#8217;m still a cancer patient and it&#8217;s not over til it&#8217;s over&#8230;.which feels like it&#8217;ll be never for me at the moment.</p>
<p>Anyway, I know I haven&#8217;t been on here for a long time but I was trying to have a &#8216;break&#8217; from it all for Christmas times&#8230;I did have some lovely times with family, friends and with Chris but it just hasn&#8217;t turned out to be the break we all so desperately needed.  I&#8217;m back in for chemo on Monday so I&#8217;ll just try to enjoy my time before then and start 2010 with a smile on my face (even if it&#8217;s hiding so much hurt, pain &amp; worry behind the smile!)</p>
<p>I hope everyone reading has had a lovely Christmas and I wish you all a happy and HEALTHY New Year xxx</p>

		<p>Sorry it&#8217;s been so long since I&#8217;ve written, I&#8217;ve had a strange few weeks.  Before going back into chemo I was keeping myself busy and making the most of feeling ok(ish) but at the same time exhausting myself and then being forced to rest as my body &amp; mind couldn&#8217;t keep up with my ambition!  I&#8217;ve had an emotional few weeks too &amp; have been a bit up and down like a yo yo!  &amp; after another meeting with Prof with lots of heavy conversations and decisions to make, my head was ready to explode!  But the short version is basically that I&#8217;m having to decide now whether to continue with chemotherapy or to stop.  I know it sounds easy &#8211; stop if I can as it&#8217;s so horrible, but if only it was that easy!  We&#8217;re in a position now where they don&#8217;t know which is better for me.  If there&#8217;s a specific reason to stop, e.g. problems with my kidneys or other organs, or more neutropenia then I&#8217;ll have to stop, no choice.  But as it&#8217;s been reduced so much and my body appears to be &#8216;coping&#8217; with it now, then it&#8217;s my choice whether to carry on.  My view has always been that I&#8217;ll go as far as I can with it, to do my best to ensure that the cancer&#8217;s gone and doesn&#8217;t come back.  But again, of course it isn&#8217;t that simple.  There&#8217;s no guarantees either way, of course&#8230;and Prof pointed out that it&#8217;s one of the chemo drugs I&#8217;m still on that could me damaging my fertility.  Unfortunately there&#8217;s no way of telling that though and probably more than likely is that if the damage is going to be done it will have been done already from the intense high dose chemo I was on before surgery.  He says he wishes he had a crystal ball to see the future for me and also that he wishes somehow he could test me out now to check my fertility!  I think the way he said that came out a bit wrong!! HAH!  All these &#8216;ifs&#8217;, &#8216;buts&#8217;, &#8216;maybes&#8217; are enough to drive you mad!  But again, it was pointed out to me that if I&#8217;m not here or if I&#8217;m not well enough to have a family then my fertility would be no use to me anyway.  Not easy but fact.</p>
<p>So anyway I decided to continue and have chemo 10 and now I&#8217;m due a break for Christmas which we all agreed was well needed and well deserved!  So now I&#8217;m just home trying to recover from this one and after several hospital appointments next week I hope I&#8217;ll be able to enjoy Christmas and a short break from being a patient.  I&#8217;m due back in for chemo on 4th January, all being well and if I still decide to go ahead.  The trouble is it&#8217;s not a kind of decision that thinking about will help as the information available isn&#8217;t going to change.  I just have to go with what feels right and to be honest I think the less thinking the better as too much time = too much thinking = worrying!  I just know that if I decide to stop the chemo and then the cancer comes back, I&#8217;ll be asking myself and wondering &#8216;what if..&#8217;, i.e. what if I&#8217;d carried on with chemo maybe it wouldn&#8217;t have returned?  I know you can&#8217;t think like that and we&#8217;ll never know why I got it in the first place, let alone if it came back again, but I just know in my heart and my head that I would think that, so I want to avoid it!</p>
<p>Well, that&#8217;s the short version of my fairly boring update&#8230;I need to get my energy and strength back up so I can tell you some more exciting news soon hopefully!  I&#8217;ll post some pics soon &#8211; our Christmas tree is up and number 2 is going up right now!</p>
<p>Promise to blog more soon so don&#8217;t blog off just yet! xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</p>

		<p> I have just heard the story of Robyn Higgins.  In May of this year a beautiful 7 year-old girl, Robyn was diagnosed with Stage 4 Neuroblastoma which is a rare and aggressive form of childhood cancer.   The tumour was growing from her pelvis and had spread to her bone marrow.   She has already been through an awful lot of treatment but to increase her chances of survival her family are trying to raise £300,000 for critical treatment she desperately needs which is currently unavailable in the UK.   Robyn  has just 2 months to raise £300k for a life saving operation in America !  So far about £35 k has been raised &amp; the clock is ticking&#8230;.even if you can not afford to donate any money yourself, please help spread the word through your friends &amp; family:</p>
<p><a href="http://robynhiggins.com/">http://robynhiggins.com/</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.justgiving.com/robyn-appeal">http://www.justgiving.com/robyn-appeal</a></p>
<p>Obviously this is so close to my heart and the moment and reading the story touched me so much.  Being a primary school teacher and with my 3 little nieces I can&#8217;t bear to think about what it would be like for someone so young to go through this.  &amp; I count myself lucky that the treatment I needed has been available to me.  I&#8217;ll never curse having to travel to Oxford again!  Please spread the word and donate or fundraise if you can, £300,000 is a lot of money but it&#8217;s nothing compared to a little girl&#8217;s life&#8230;</p>

		<p>I can&#8217;t believe I forgot to write in my post that yesterday I went round Sainsbury&#8217;s bald!  Breaking news! It&#8217;s the first time I&#8217;ve done it in public and it was actually fine!  I&#8217;d been round a few shops in Fleet and got really really hot so when we got back to the car I took my wig off and slung it on the dashboard (see below!)  So we went to Sainsbury&#8217;s and I just thought, why am I going to put my wig back on?  It&#8217;s certainly not for my own comfort, it&#8217;s basically to make other people feel comfortable so I blend in and don&#8217;t stand out as the girl with the &#8220;I&#8217;ve got cancer&#8221; beacon on my head!  (I don&#8217;t actually have one of those you understand, THAT would be weird!)  So I just did it.  &amp; it was fine.  I could feel people looking and could read their minds and at times I felt like shouting out &#8220;Yes I&#8217;ve got cancer!&#8221; to answer their thoughts!  But I  managed to get round the shop without shouting at anyone and I didn&#8217;t even feel that stared at to be honest, I didn&#8217;t pay any attention, just got on with my shopping.  &amp; who cares anyway?!</p>
<p>I did fall in love with these Innocent smoothies with little tiny knitted bobble hats on though.  I had to buy them, they were looking at me!  &amp; now they match me with my wooly hat!  I wish they fitted me!</p>

		<p>You&#8217;ll be pleased to know that this post is written:</p>
<p>a) at 1pm, not stupid o&#8217;clock in the morning!</p>
<p>b) I&#8217;m not feeling high or low on drugs!</p>
<p>c) I&#8217;m at home!</p>
<p>After the weekend which was busy sorting things out around the house etc. I went back into Frimley Park Hospital on Monday for a planned blood count check.  As you&#8217;ll know, usually I end up having to stay in, having gone neutropenic and needing IV antibiotics everytime apart from last time, and needing blood transfusions and platelets every time.  This time I was feeling much better and had a good feeling about it&#8230;I was still exhausted but in a different way and more because I&#8217;d been busy and not sleeping rather than just being exhausted from the drugs.  Anyway, I was optimistic and so took less stuff with me (less than the usual car full of pinkness I take!) but I still had to go prepared to stay in so had a few days worth of pj&#8217;s etc.  So Monday was spent in my own room in the private suite, lunch and dinner enjoyed there (poor Goose watching me eat it!) and it got to the evening and we&#8217;d still had no results.  So my sister came in to visit me and Chris was on his way to visit when I was told my blood count was fine and I could go home!  So at about 8.30pm I left!  Chris literally arrived just after I was told so in fact picked me up rather than visited!  It was very bizarre spending the day and evening in the room and then leaving!  Luckily I hadn&#8217;t changed into my pjs as I was feeling better than normal and hopeful that I might be discharged.  So I&#8217;ve been at home all week!  No blood transfusions, no platelets, no drips, no being woken at stupid o&#8217;clock, just home sweet home!  It&#8217;s been lovely to spend time here and to do some of the things I like to do and just to relax.  I&#8217;m still having to take it easy as it&#8217;s still my vulnerable time and I&#8217;ve got to go back tomorrow for another blood count check just in case.  But hopefully that&#8217;ll be fine and I&#8217;m free until 30th November when chemo 10 is due&#8230;apart from 27th November which is another trip to Oxford to see Prof and discuss my progress.</p>
<p>So all in all good news.  I&#8217;m feeling better than I usually do and I&#8217;m at home.  The steroids are finished for a few weeks so I&#8217;m more back to normal.  I&#8217;m making it sound easy  now but it&#8217;s still far from it.  I&#8217;m generally happy and cheerful and just getting on with it, taking each day as it comes but also planning for the days ahead so I can make the most of them.  Yet I&#8217;ve still managed to have some outbursts of tears when the floodgates have opened and I just can&#8217;t stopped&#8230;I can&#8217;t tell you why, there&#8217;s not just one reason.  It&#8217;s just cancer and everything that comes with it and sometimes it just hits me all over again.  Chris usually has the pleasure of this as it&#8217;s usually at night when I lie down to go to sleep when everything comes into my head.  But all girls will know that sometimes you just need a good cry and lots of cuddles and everything seems better after that.  &amp; so that&#8217;s what I did!</p>
<p>Right, well that&#8217;s all for now.  If you&#8217;re on facebook, have a look at my latest pics and the video I&#8217;ve put on my wall.   You will LAUGH!  I&#8217;ve sent it into You&#8217;ve Been Framed, I hope it gets on!  I&#8217;ll try to post it on here soon if I can work it out!</p>
<p>Thanks again for all your messages and comments, more and more of you are coming out of the woodwork!  Like I&#8217;ve said before, I love finding out who&#8217;s reading and I&#8217;ve got back in touch with so many people from years ago because of it, which I love!  So don&#8217;t be shy!</p>

		<p>&#8230;that&#8217;s what the leaflet from the steroids I&#8217;m on tells me I could be (alongside the other 3,000 possible side effects!)  I&#8217;ve pretty much given up reading leaflets for my medications as they all tell you an endless list of possible side effects, most of which I&#8217;ve already got happening from the chemo or other medication and am trying to get rid of!  So reading them usually just turns into a waste of time!  But now that I&#8217;m awake at 1.31 am and don&#8217;t want to be awake, I&#8217;m wondering why!  &amp; remembering that I&#8217;ve been on more steroids the last few days than usual and that as Goose read the leaflet to me while I got up this morning, she said they could make my hyperactive, or depressed, or swing between the 2!  Lovely!  Alongside the hot flushes, increased appetite and weight gain, I&#8217;m a right catch at the moment!  Surely that&#8217;s a sure fire recipe for depression anyway &#8211; can&#8217;t sleep, fat and sweaty!  Mmmmm attractive!</p>
<p>Anyway I&#8217;m on here because I can&#8217;t sleep.  I think I have actually been quite hyperactive the last few days, whether it&#8217;s the drugs or a natural high because I don&#8217;t feel as bad as I normally do, I don&#8217;t know.  I&#8217;m much, much better than I usually am at this point after chemo, probably due to another reduction in one of the chemo drugs.  I&#8217;m still booked in to hospital on Monday though to be checked as no risks can be taken as you never know what&#8217;s around the corner, that&#8217;s for sure!  I&#8217;ve also managed to go shopping today which always helps with hyperactivity!  &amp; been to physio and been told I can walk on just 1 crutch (or crunch for those of you who read about that!) from now on!  So all in all quite a productive day&#8230;lots of Christmas shopping done already which is unheard of for me this early!  But now here I am, should be exhausted&#8230;AM exhausted in fact, but can&#8217;t sleep.</p>
<p>My brain is working overtime.  I feel like I&#8217;m in a movie&#8230;the wind and the rain is crashing around outside, blowing a gale.  If this was a film or a book it would be written like that to depict my frame of mind&#8230;the gale outside, the thoughts in my head!  But don&#8217;t worry I won&#8217;t go down that road or get that deep!</p>
<p>I think the main reason my mind can&#8217;t turn off tonight is something I haven&#8217;t shared on here before.  It&#8217;s something anyone who&#8217;s been on this journey with me will know about and will know how soul destroying it is for me.  It&#8217;s the fact that on 20th April when I was told I had cancer, that wasn&#8217;t actually what upset me the most.  Not the thought of losing my hair or having my life as I knew it crash around me.  Not the fear of whether I&#8217;d keep my leg, or live or die.  I&#8217;d prepared myself for all of that in a weird way&#8230;during the weeks from the biopsy to hearing the results I&#8217;d been through all the &#8216;what ifs&#8217;, the devestation, the &#8216;why me?&#8217;, the scouring the internet for information on bone cancer that might make me feel better, but of course didn&#8217;t give me what I wanted to hear.  I think I was better prepared for the diagnosis than anyone else because I JUST KNEW.  I really did just know that it was going to be cancer.  But what I didn&#8217;t know and hadn&#8217;t prepared myself for in any way was to be told that the chemotherapy was to be so intense that it would be highly likely to leave me infertile.  This shocked and knocked and devestated me more than anything.  The conversation in that room about my future fertility was a short one, with so much other information to take in.  But it was a simple one.  Prof clearly said that it would take 6 weeks to harvest my eggs and we didn&#8217;t have time because I needed to start the chemo asap.  My dad, knowing and seeing how much having children means to me, asked &#8216;what if Cara does decide to harvest eggs and wait the 6 weeks?&#8217;  Prof simply answered &#8216;We&#8217;d be talking about Cara&#8217;s life.&#8217;  As in risking it.  I just could not speak at this point.  Something that doesn&#8217;t happen very often!</p>
<p>So&#8230;there we are.  That&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve found hardest to deal with I think to be honest, although there&#8217;s no possible way of ordering what&#8217;s hardest about coping and living with this evil disease and such intense treatment and life change.  Anyone who knows me at all will know how much I love and adore children and that having a family of my own has always been THE most important thing to me.  &amp; not to sound too soppy but since meeting Chris and us being so right, those feelings have only got stronger.  Since an early time in our relationship we&#8217;ve joked and dreamed about our little family one day&#8230;3 kids and Barney (our future St Bernard!)  We have our little jokes about whether they&#8217;ll be boys or girls but in our hearts of course all we want is to have children of our own&#8230;or even just a child of our own.   We&#8217;ve talked about it lots and both agree that when the time comes we&#8217;ll do ANYTHING we can to make it happen&#8230;and if all else fails we would look into adoption.  Chris tells me we need to take one thing at a time and I know he&#8217;s right.  He tells me I just need to focus on getting better first and then on enjoying life and having some &#8216;me&#8217; time and then we&#8217;ll look to the future and deal with whatever comes our way.  If we can get through this, we can get through anything.  &amp; I know he&#8217;s right and he&#8217;s so practical and positive about things, it&#8217;s amazing.  But me being me, and being female, I can&#8217;t be that practical all of the time as emotions get in the way!  I tell myself not to worry or think about it and I&#8217;m not letting it take over or anything as I do think I&#8217;m managing very well.  BUT&#8230;there&#8217;s not a single minute of a single day that it isn&#8217;t on my mind in some way.  With something so important to me potentially being taken away all because of this stupid illness that&#8217;s come from nowhere and is no-one&#8217;s fault&#8230;well there&#8217;s just no answers to any of it are there?!  But what I do know and think of ALL the time, is that it could be worse.  I&#8217;m not the worse off that I could be, like I keep saying I&#8217;ve got fantastic support from SO many people and an amazing life other than Cancer and all that comes with it.  Which is more than you could possibly imagine.  But I do count myself lucky lots of times everyday, no matter how down the rest of it gets me, I&#8217;m still here and I&#8217;m still smiling (mostly!)</p>
<p>Right, I&#8217;ll cheer up now.  On a positive note, I&#8217;ve heard of lots of absolutely amazing stories of girls who have been through similar illnesses and treatments to me and have even been categorically told that they&#8217;ll be infertile, yet have gone on to conceive naturally and now have happy, healthy children!  It&#8217;s stories like that I have to keep in my mind, to give me hope.  &amp; I haven&#8217;t been told categorically NO, just HIGHLY UNLIKELY.  Well, if I&#8217;m rare enough to get this type of cancer in the first place, I figure I&#8217;m rare enough to be a mummy against all odds!  Think we&#8217;ll forget 3 &#8211; let&#8217;s go for 6, 3 sets of twins!  EEEEK!</p>
<p>Sorry for the heaviness of this post.  I&#8217;ve been feeling for a while like I wanted to share this, but it&#8217;s a scary thing to talk (type!) about as it just means so much and makes me feel so fragile&#8230;but  I talk about it alot openly though so I figure why not do the same on here as it seems to be helping me and others to get through this, so why not!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll leave you now and promise (well I&#8217;ll try!) to make my next post more cheerful!&#8230;</p>
<p>FYI it&#8217;s only 41 days until Christmas!  &amp; I&#8217;m VERY excited already!  If that doesn&#8217;t make you smile, you&#8217;re a SCROOGE and you should cheer up and get in the festive spirit!</p>
<p>Love xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</p>
<p>P.S. It&#8217;s now 2.09 am and I&#8217;m still wide awake!  I want to catch some zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz <img src="../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":-(" class="wp-smiley" /></p>

		<p>Well I&#8217;m nearly at the end of chemo number 9 now&#8230;they&#8217;re speeding up the end so I can go home tonight&#8230;YAY!  Although it&#8217;s been reduced AGAIN, it&#8217;s still wiped me out and never fails to surprise me how tired it makes me.  Although compared to the high dose intense chemo I was on before, it&#8217;s nothing!  It&#8217;s all relative though&#8230;</p>
<p>I had a great weekend with lots of laughs and have some funny videos and pics to post on here&#8230;not sure I have the energy at the moment though so I shall try in the next few days when I&#8217;m back home.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got so much I want to write on  here but my brain is always either bursting full of thoughts, feelings, fears etc. or it&#8217;s empty!  There&#8217;s so much going around in there but on the other hand, I&#8217;m so bored of it all and fed up of it, sometimes I just try to wipe it all out&#8230;not often succesfully, there&#8217;s certain things I think about every minute of every day whether I like it or not!  As for how useful my brain is nowadays I&#8217;m really  not sure!  My stubble on my head is looking quite blonde now, so looks like I&#8217;ll have my excuse for my blonde moments back eventually!  It&#8217;s so long now since I&#8217;ve had anything nearly as important or relevant as all that comes with having cancer, I forgotten how to think about anything else!  Although I do try to do brain training on my DS most days&#8230;I go through phases, but my brain age is pretty good nowadays!  &amp; I&#8217;m very good at thinking about, dreaming of and now searching online for holidays for when this is &#8216;over&#8217;&#8230;although I don&#8217;t see how it&#8217;ll ever be truly over at the moment, being in remission is very different from it being over, physically and mentally and I&#8217;m not even there yet.</p>
<p>Anyway great news is that I&#8217;ve been given Christmas back!  Prof said I won&#8217;t have the chemo that I thought I&#8217;d have on 21st December, that they&#8217;ll give me a break for Christmas, YAY!  I was so excited as although I would&#8217;ve been home just in time for Christmas, I would have been exhausted and not able to enjoy it properly, then having to go back into hospital the following week and possibly staying in for New Year&#8217;s Eve.  Not that I&#8217;m a great fan of New Year but I&#8217;d still rather not be in hospital!  But Christmas I LOVE and am soooooooooooooooo excited about it now!  Been doing lots of Christmas shopping online from my hospital bed and making plans for seeing friends and family over the Christmas hols.  I can&#8217;t wait!</p>
<p>Right well I&#8217;m exhausting myself now so off I go&#8230;lunch will be on it&#8217;s way soon, gross!  I hope Goose will arrive soon so she can be something from the cafe downstairs instead!  Goose deserves a medal for how she&#8217;s been there for me this year in sooooo many ways&#8230;and we haven&#8217;t even got annoyed with each other once (well I guess I can only speak for myself on that one!) or had cross words or anything.  She deserves lots of treating and spoiling when I&#8217;m up to doing things for her.</p>
<p>Lots of love and thank you to all my bloggers again, new and old!! xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</p>
