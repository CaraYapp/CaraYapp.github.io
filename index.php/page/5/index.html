		<p>Hi there!Â  Well it&#8217;s been a long time since I&#8217;ve been on here and just to give you some idea of how it&#8217;s been&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;fed up&#8230;had enough&#8230;can&#8217;t do it&#8230;don&#8217;t want to do it&#8230;wish had never happened&#8230;why did I have to find out?Â  Why me?Â  What have I done?Â  Not fair&#8230;so unfair&#8230;I&#8217;m so unhappy&#8230;I can&#8217;t be positive&#8230;what is there to be positive about?Â  I can&#8217;t stand it&#8230;I&#8217;m going mad&#8230;I&#8217;m going crazy&#8230;what am I supposed to do?Â  I wish someone could DO something&#8230;I wish I could DO something&#8230;I want to punch someone!Â  No I don&#8217;t&#8230;I want a punch bag!Â  I want to throw things around and SCREAM!Â  I want to curl up in a ball and for it all to disappear&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;just some of the things I&#8217;ve been thinking and feeling (&amp; saying!) the last few weeks.Â  I haven&#8217;t been on here as I&#8217;ve been either too ill or too upset and fed up&#8230;or both!Â  I think it&#8217;s hard for lots of people to understand just how ill I am when I&#8217;m really poorly.Â  Obviously my family and Chris see me through all of it so they know how I am everyday.Â  I don&#8217;t blame people for not understanding&#8230;it must be impossible to when you don&#8217;t see me.Â  I&#8217;m only really seeing people when I&#8217;m a bit better as that&#8217;s when I feel up to seeing you but that doesn&#8217;t show anyone what I&#8217;m like during the really bad times.Â  I haven&#8217;t felt like sharing on here as I feel like I&#8217;m all doom and gloom and I don&#8217;t want to inflict that on everyone else &#8211; that&#8217;s no fun to read!Â  But then those closest to me have pointed out that the point of this blog isn&#8217;t actually for your entertainment!Â  I started it to help me to get everything out of my head and also to help you all to understand how I&#8217;m feeling and I&#8217;m not helping you to do that if I hide all the negatives.Â  So I&#8217;m sorry if it&#8217;s not much fun to read and if I depress you all I apologise but I&#8217;m only telling it how it is and hopefully that&#8217;ll help me and all of you to get through this&#8230;</p>

		<p>Hey,</p>
<p>Well today I&#8217;ve been told I can go home!Â  YAY!Â  I&#8217;m just waiting for my drugs to come to take home so I can be discharged.Â  It&#8217;s no wonder I&#8217;m not rattling with all the pills I&#8217;m taking!Â  I&#8217;m really looking forward to getting home and being &#8216;normal&#8217; for a few days before chemo number 3.Â  Plus I&#8217;ll be home to watch The Apprentice tonight, yay!Â  Priorities!Â  I just want to curl up in my own bed and sleep and sleep and sleep!!</p>
<p>I now have a wig that I LOVE!Â  &amp; it&#8217;s free on the NHS.Â  Worth Â£200!Â  Amazing really!Â  They sent me 2 again cos I wasn&#8217;t sure.Â  When I went to the place I had to try the styles on in really dark colours and choose the colours separately so they could be ordered.Â  They&#8217;re both gorgeous but one of them&#8217;s a bit too glam and long and I look a bit like Paris Hilton or Sharpay from HSM!Â  Not quite so natural or practical.Â  The one I&#8217;m going to keep is a lovely colour, really natural and not so long but still long and shaped really nicely.Â  Laura, Gemma W, Lou, Katie and Sarah all saw them last night!Â  We had a bit of a trying on session!Â  They all think you wouldn&#8217;t know it was a wig if you didn&#8217;t know but I&#8217;m not sure if they&#8217;re just being kind!!Â  It is amazing though and I do love it.Â  I&#8217;ve just got to find the guts to wear it now though!Â  If I make it to Katie&#8217;s party for a bit on Saturday I might have to brave it!Â  It&#8217;s funny cos I&#8217;ve also got the blonde bob style one that I bought before so now I can choose to have long or short hair and be able to swap in an instant!Â  Very bizarre!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve now lost a stone on the &#8216;chemo diet&#8217;!!Â  I wouldn&#8217;t recommend it though!Â  I don&#8217;t feel like I&#8217;ve lost that much or look like I have but I&#8217;m not surprised with how little I&#8217;ve eaten and how much I&#8217;ve been sick!Â  Alot of it I think it muscle wasting away too.Â  My legs seem alot smaller, I think just cos they&#8217;ve barely been used!Â  I feel like Ariel from The Little Mermaid when she gets legs and is all wobbly and can&#8217;t walk on them!Â  I wish I was a mermaid &#8211; I was thinking, if I didn&#8217;t have legs I wouldn&#8217;t be able to have a tumour in my leg&#8230;I doubt you can get tumours in a mermaid&#8217;s tail&#8230;.hmmmmmm.Â  Anyway I&#8217;m either her or bambi on ice!Â  I&#8217;m going to attempt to walk to the car when I leave which will be a big achievement!Â  I haven&#8217;t walked further than the toilet for 2 or 3 weeks now!</p>
<p>Yesterday Goose (my mum!) came in and we went on a little adventure around Frimley Park Hospital looking for places to sit outside.Â  We got an ice cream (which I could only eat a third of&#8230;I&#8217;ve changed!!) and found a little courtyard to sit in.Â  It was SO nice to be outside as I&#8217;ve missed ALL this amazing weather.Â  Plus I got dressed for the first time!Â  It was nice to have a pretty dress on instead of pj&#8217;s&#8230;.although it&#8217;s a good job I love pj&#8217;s cos I&#8217;ve lived in them for weeks!Â  Primark&#8217;s profits are up thanks to me and my pj shopping recently!</p>
<p>Well I better go and start packing up my room which is full of pinkness!Â  I&#8217;ve been looking for lovely hotels to go to as me and Chris might go away for a night or 2 on my next so called &#8216;good&#8217; weekend&#8230;just somewhere quiet and peaceful and luxurious not too far away.Â  I think we just deserve to get away for a few days!</p>
<p>Well lots of love to you all, ciao for now!!</p>

		<p>Well here I am back again in the land of the living&#8230;well almost!  Sorry to all of those of you who&#8217;ve been missing the blog, I&#8217;ve had lots of people messaging me very upset they can&#8217;t get their daily dose!  I&#8217;ve been thinking about it lots but I&#8217;ve basically had a really really rough 2 weeks which lots of you will now know.</p>
<p>Basically after the first chemo I became really exhausted after a while and was stuck in bed at home with no interest in anything.  Then I picked up a bit but ended up in A&#038;E neutropenic.  That&#8217;s basically when the chemo makes my blood count of white cells so low I have no immune system and if I pick up any sort of infection my body can&#8217;t fight it at all.  There&#8217;s something called neutrophylls in your blood and it&#8217;s when they go low and it can be very dangerous if untreated.  So I have to look out for certain symptoms at home, temperature being the main indication.  Anyway so I ended up in A&#038;E and to cut a long story short ended up staying in Frimley Park for nearly a week.  It was a nightmare.  I also went anaemic which is when your red cells (haemoglobin) goes really low so I had to have a blood transfusion.  I managed to get home for 2 days before having to go back into Oxford for chemo number 2.  </p>
<p>The 2nd round of chemo really took it out of me alot more and was really harrowing.  I basically just lay there the whole time, with no energy for tv or reading or talking or anything.  That&#8217;s right&#8230;ME&#8230;not talking!  THAT&#8217;S when you know I&#8217;m really ill!!  The sickness started much earlier and went on MUCH longer too.  I got home from that last Saturday but was just so so sick and confined to be all week being sick.  Too weak to even get up by myself to go to the toilet.  I was the worst I&#8217;ve been so far.  Then again, on Thursday I ended up in A&#038;E.  This time in an ambulance because I was too weak to go any other way!  I was carried down my stairs at home my the paramedics in this special chair.  God knows how they managed to carry me, I was concerned they might collapse and need another ambulance!!  Again I was neutropenic and much more so this time.  So another long story short and I&#8217;m still in Frimley Park now.  Luckily this time I&#8217;m much happier and more comfortable as I&#8217;m in the private ward.  Again I&#8217;ve had lots of drugs for the infection and went very anaemic and needed another blood transfusion on Sunday.  This time 3 units of blood and platelets separately too.  I&#8217;ve had a mouth infection and ridiculously sore mouth from the chemo so literally didn&#8217;t eat for weeks!  7 stone here I come!  It doesn&#8217;t sound so appealing now though anymore!  I&#8217;m improving alot and am hoping to get home tomorrow or if not Thursday so I can have at least a few days at home before I&#8217;m in for chemo number 3, which I&#8217;m dreading.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s the last few weeks in a nutshell.  The very short version!  I&#8217;m afraid there&#8217;s been a lot less funny stories to tell!  Although it&#8217;s just all so surreal what becomes normal.  Peeing and pooing into cardboard trays is just normal now!  OOh was quite bizarre being bathed in bed by a big black woman VERY vigorously cos I was too week to bath or shower!!  Luckily my mum was in there with me!  Very surreal though and a bit scary!!   &#038; you should see the disposable knickers you get given by the hospital!  They&#8217;re like fishnet stockings but knickers!!  But not in a good way!!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s much calmer in this ward and I haven&#8217;t had any oriental men demanding I pee or philipino cleaners!  They were in the ward I was in at Frimley last time.  They chattered away non stop but god knows what about! One of them was trying to tell me about a vegetable one morning but it was all a bit too confusing for both of us!</p>
<p>Well lots of detail has been missed the past few weeks but I&#8217;ve got to hold something back for my book or none of you will buy it!</p>
<p>My hair&#8217;s almost all gone now.  Not sure if I look like a baby or an old lady.  I feel like a cross between the 2 aswell!  I just want to be bald now really (well obviously not really but got no choice!) but I don&#8217;t want the trauma of shaving it so I&#8217;m just waiting for the last wispy bits to go.  It&#8217;s extremely attractive&#8230;.?!</p>
<p>Well I&#8217;ll try to keep up more with the writing now but you know if I disappear it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m too unwell to get on the computer.  I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll be seeing lots of you over the weekend if all goes well so I can make the most of my &#8216;good&#8217; days before going back to Oxford for chemo.</p>
<p>Happy reading.  Sorry this one&#8217;s a bit boring &#8211; just an update really!<br />
Lots of love<br />
Cara xxx</p>

		<p>Evening!</p>
<p>Tonight I am shattered so I won&#8217;t write much&#8230;I know I always say that but this time it&#8217;s true&#8230;I hope, or I&#8217;ll wake up drooling on my pretty pink laptop having fallen asleep!!Â  I didn&#8217;t sleep too well last night with stomach pains and although I&#8217;ve still had a &#8216;lazy&#8217; day I&#8217;ve probably done the most I&#8217;ve done in 10 days since this all started so I&#8217;m shattered.</p>
<p>The day got off to a bizarre start when lots of parcels arrived (ebay, oops!)Â  But not all ebay, the wigs I&#8217;d ordered to see from the shop who provide 1 free wig via the NHS.Â  Let&#8217;s just say for now that they didn&#8217;t look in reality how they looked in the catalogues!!Â  Me and my mum had a funny morning trying them on though and taking pics!Â  I&#8217;ll attempt to put my wig catalogue so far onto here soon!Â  So I think I need to make a trip to the store up near the hospital if I&#8217;m feeling well enough next time I&#8217;m up there.Â  They provided a great source of entertainment though&#8230;especially when Chris got home this evening and tried the blondest of them all on!!Â  Yes I have a photo!!Â  But although entertaining it was actually pretty disturbing having them in my house.Â  It was more fun in the shop.Â  It seemed like playing in the shop.Â  Now it seems real and there are these &#8216;creatures&#8217; hanging around my lounge like rats or ferrets or something!Â  I even had to order some &#8216;heads&#8217; online today to put them on when I finally get one or 2 I like (or can put up with!)Â  Sooooo bizarre, when did ordering wigs and heads become normal?Â  Shall we look through Next Directory?Â  Naah let&#8217;s look through the wig brochure again!Â  ODD!Â  Anyway sure it&#8217;ll all work out fine and we&#8217;ll all see the funny side&#8230;we&#8217;re just scared the heads and the wigs will join forces in the night and attack us in our sleep!Â  I hate dolls and stuff like that, I should never have watched Chucky when I was younger!!Â  Suffice to say the wigs and the heads will be consigned to the spare room&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;right I&#8217;m off, not so much to report today I&#8217;m afraid&#8230;apart from to say that Anna, Thalia, my mum, Anna&#8217;s mum and soon to be Corinne my aunt aswell are now (some running some walking!) Race for Life in aid of Cancer Research UK in Basingstoke on Sunday 21st June.Â  It&#8217;s a great achievement for me to have persuaded my mum and my aunt so please give generously!Â  I know I&#8217;m asking for sponsors non stop but we&#8217;ve got some boys v girls rivalry now so I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll all want to help with that!Â  Or if you&#8217;d rather join &#8216;Team Scamp&#8217; then let me know and you can join them! Go to <a href="http://www.raceforlifesponsorme.org/teamscamp">http://www.raceforlifesponsorme.org/teamscamp</a>.Â  My other friends Gemma, Lou and Katie are running Race for Life in Reading instead on 19th JulyÂ so if you&#8217;d rather join or sponsor them if it&#8217;s more convenient, that&#8217;s <a href="http://www.raceforlifesponsorme.org/teamcara">http://www.raceforlifesponsorme.org/teamcara</a>Â  It&#8217;s a hard life having so many teams!!Â  Even all my doctors etc. are calling themselves Team Cara!Â  I don&#8217;t know when that became normal either but lots of things that once would&#8217;ve been odd are now normal and vice versa!</p>
<p>Right I&#8217;m off as I promised myself and you that it&#8217;d be short!Â  You&#8217;re probably all still reading last night&#8217;s entry anyway!Â  Keep blogging!!Â  Or tell me to blog off if you&#8217;d prefer!<br />
Love you all</p>

		<p>Well here I am&#8230;vertical&#8230;as in not horizontal!Â  Well when I say vertical, I only mean semi&#8230;I still can&#8217;t stand up much or for long!Â  I&#8217;m not sure when exactly it became an achievement to get downstairs but now it is and I did it!Â  Instead of the day spent it bed it was mainly spent on the sofa and lots of sitting not just lying&#8230;Â  &amp; in tracky bottoms instead of PJ&#8217;s! Wahoo!Â  It&#8217;s strange at the moment, not sure if I feel like a toddler or an old lady but I&#8217;m definitely more like a 2 year old or a 90 year old&#8230;certainly don&#8217;t feel like a 26 year old anymore!Â  But how many of you can say you had a more excitingÂ day than me???Â  Oh&#8230;all of you, ok!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still not feeling veryÂ human but definetely alotÂ better than I was.Â  Tastebuds doing strange things&#8230; mouth feels like it&#8217;s full of little demons nibbling at my gums!Â  I&#8217;ve got special mouthwash to help but it&#8217;s due to get alot worse with ulcers etc. to be expected from the chemo.Â  Am a bit sicky but haven&#8217;t been sick since Sunday as am on soooo many anti-sickness and steroids.Â  Still very dizzy and tired and wobbly and just not right&#8230;but have progressed alot just throughout the day&#8230;my mum&#8217;s been babysitting while Chris is at work&#8230;it&#8217;s very cute, they do little handovers!!Â  Again, am I 2 or 90?Â  I&#8217;m not sure but I&#8217;m very well looked after and very lucky that&#8217;s for sure.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t been this perky all day though, trust me&#8230;Â  This morning I wanted to just keep closing my eyes and hoped that eventually I&#8217;d open them and realise it was all a dream.Â  So I could roll over and tell Chris my ridiculous dream and he&#8217;d laugh at me!Â  Obviously not &#8230;but it still seems possible somehow that it&#8217;s not real&#8230;Â  Before, when I found out,Â it seemed real and I was facing it and being positive.Â  Now I&#8217;ve got all this time just to do nothing and rest, it seems impossible.Â  They must&#8217;ve made a mistake?Â  My knee DOESN&#8217;T EVEN HURT!!Â  Then I go through that in my head and face that it&#8217;s real again but just wish that this one round of chemo could be it.Â  The thought of 5 more and THEN surgery, rehab, physio, and THEN MOOOOOREEE chemo just makes me want to give up right now.Â  Which is why all the advice is for small steps which is how I have to focus.Â  Literally day by day at the moment.Â  Am already dreading 2 weeks today though being admitted again and pumped full of it all over again&#8230;.</p>
<p>Still no hair loss yet.Â  I&#8217;ve got the silk pillow cases on now&#8230;recommended by Anna&#8230;purchased via ebay.Â  I swear if this is ever a published book, ebay will have to sponsor me or pay for the privilige of being mentioned so much!Â  Seriously actually, if you&#8217;re into buying shares, buy some in ebay &#8211; they&#8217;re about to soar!Â  Think our postman&#8217;s going to be straining his arms with all the parcels that are arriving!Â  Like I keep saying, ebay should be banned for cancer patients who are diagnosed and left unsupervised all night with internet access&#8230;from bed!!Â  Anyway&#8230;silk pillow cases!Â Â  They&#8217;re supposed to mean less hair falls out at night because they don&#8217;t tug&#8230;they won&#8217;t stop the hair loss but should mean it&#8217;s less upsetting in the mornings as that&#8217;s often when alot falls out.Â  Plus apparently they&#8217;re great for your skin so even if I do look like Uncle Fester or Duncan Goodhew, I&#8217;ll have lovely skin!!Â  They feel lovely&#8230;although Chris isn&#8217;t using them&#8230;I did offer but we both agreed he probably wouldn&#8217;t appreciate them so much!Â  I did have a scare this morning though!Â  We were lying in bed&#8230;.after my 3 billion attempts at closing my eyes and pretending it was I dream&#8230;I had to face reality and talk about it!Â  My hair (although I had it cut short is still fairly long round the front) was flopped on the pillow and Chris went to grab a bit of fluff or something and I jumped out of my skin!!!Â  I thought he was just going to pick up the clump of hair I could see out of the corner of my eye!Â  I thought it was just lying there!Â  Anyway&#8230;it was still attached&#8230;firmly!Â  &amp; Chris got the bit of fluff successfully!Â  But that&#8217;s what&#8217;s soooooo weird&#8230;obviously I BELIEVE them that it&#8217;ll fall out (YES it will.Â  I know with some chemo it doesn&#8217;t but apparently what I&#8217;m having is alot and it&#8217;s agressive chemo and lots of it and it will fall out pretty soon&#8230;)&#8230;but at the moment I just can&#8217;t imagine it&#8230;I can TUG TUG TUG at it and it&#8217;s not coming!Â  One of these days I&#8217;ll be saying to someone &#8220;Look at this, TUG TUG TUG and it doesn&#8217;t fall ou&#8230;..oooops&#8230;aaaah loooooook!!!!&#8221;Â  Who will be the lucky person?!</p>
<p>While we&#8217;re on the subject of hair I have to share some funny comments Chris made when we first found out about this (still only 2 weeks ago!)Â  To be fair to him, he was VERY tired and half asleep in bed and I was obviously chatter chatter chattering&#8230;.just a normal night in the Yapp/Newton household!!Â  Only this time it was different because that day I&#8217;d be told I&#8217;d got cancer.Â  Now don&#8217;t go all silly and think he was being insensitive because he wasn&#8217;t and he&#8217;s been and is being truly amazing.Â  This was just a &#8216;weak&#8217; moment after hours of saying the right thing and comforting me!!Â  So instead of letting him sleep, my verbal diarrhoea continued&#8230;.YAPP YAPP YAPP!!Â  So there I am thinking about all the trivial things that come into your head after about 12 hours of knowing you&#8217;ve got cancer&#8230;</p>
<p>Me (wide awake): &#8220;Oh no, now I won&#8217;t be able to use any lovely shampoos or anything!&#8221;Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â </p>
<p>Chris (half asleep): &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry baby, you might still want to use them on your skull&#8221;Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â </p>
<p>Me (a insy bit mad by now!): &#8220;What do you MEAN, my SKULL?!!Â  I&#8217;m not going to be a skeleton, there&#8217;ll still be skin, I&#8217;ll still have a scalp!!&#8221;Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â </p>
<p>Him (very confused&#8230;and sorry!): &#8220;Oh no, scalp, I meant scalp, not skull, scalp, sorry baby, sorry scamp, baaaaaaaby&#8230;..&#8221;Â  I&#8217;ll leave the grovelling out!</p>
<p>Anyway then a few minutes later (I forgive easily and we laughed alot&#8230;or maybe that wasn&#8217;t til the next day we laughed!!) he&#8217;s back in his sleepy daze and I&#8217;m back in my &#8216;wired&#8217; state of confusion and knowing I&#8217;m not going to get ANY sleep (cue ebay!!)&#8230;and I&#8217;m off again:</p>
<p>Me (remember I&#8217;ve just forgiven him for the skull comment!) &#8220;I won&#8217;t be able to wear a wig ALL the time, they might be hot, they might be itchy, they might look awful&#8221;Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â </p>
<p>Chris (nearly asleep again!) : &#8220;Well baby, you don&#8217;t know, you might not always want to wear wigs, you might end up wearing balaclavas lots of the time&#8221;Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â<br />
Me (is he trying to piss me off!): &#8220;BALACLAVAS???? WHY the HELL would I want to wear BALACLAVAS???Â  I&#8217;m going to have chemo not become a friggin (doubt I said friggin!!) bank robber?!!!&#8221;<br />
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â<br />
Him (in sleepy daze&#8230;uh oh!): &#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?Â  What did I say?Â  What&#8217;s wrong?!&#8221;</p>
<p>He meant BANDANAS.Â  NOT balaclavas.Â  He&#8217;s special&#8230;very special!!Â  Ha ha no but seriously he may well kill me for putting this on here&#8230;but along with him and my bro asking about &#8216;viewing&#8217; times, I have to include these things.Â  &amp; if I can&#8217;t be cheeky and take the p**s out of everyone now, then when can I?!Â  There has to be some perks&#8230;.although I&#8217;m not sure who I&#8217;m kidding as I did it before anyway&#8230;just got an extra excuse now!Â  Anyway I could be doing ANYTHING on here now, anything&#8217;s possible when Arsenal v Man U is on TV&#8230;even when your boyfriend supports Liverpool!Â  Hee hee he&#8217;ll tell me off for that too as to be fair he is cooking me dinner at the same time.Â  Love him.Â  I know those of you who know him don&#8217;t need me to say it, but he I am truly lucky to have him by my side through this and his strength and support in this, along with that of my family and friends, will get me through this&#8230;.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to cry now and lots of people keep telling me off for making me cry on here too&#8230;but I hope you&#8217;ve laughed more than cried tonight&#8230;that is if you&#8217;re still reading!Â  Keep making comments on here, I am reading them and appreciate each and every one of them.Â Â  So please do comment even if you&#8217;re unsure or don&#8217;t know me that well or think you might upset me.Â  It doesn&#8217;t matter, just do it.Â  (&amp; if you&#8217;reÂ a publisher, or an editor of a magazine who would be interested in me as a collumnist then really, please DO comment, don&#8217;t be shy!!)</p>
<p>Thank you so much also to everyone who&#8217;s generously donated to Chris and Robin&#8217;s half marathon for cancer research&#8230;we&#8217;re already up to Â£1165 which is unbelievable and we&#8217;re far from plaguing all of our contacts yet&#8230;so watch out!Â  No seriously though, if you&#8217;d like to sponsor them, go toÂ <a href="http://www.justgiving.com/robinandchris">http://www.justgiving.com/robinandchris</a> and every little helps.Â  If you&#8217;ve got any fundraising ideas for cancer charities that you&#8217;d like to do but feel you don&#8217;t have time, let me know!Â  I can be a fundraising manager from my bed&#8230;I&#8217;m sure all my charms and persuasions won&#8217;t go with my hair&#8230;I&#8217;ll be able to sweet talk some sponsors!</p>
<p>Until tomorrow&#8230;night night<br />

		<p>I can&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s now Monday I&#8217;m typing this and the last time was Friday&#8230;it all feels very surreal&#8230;like I&#8217;ve lost the weekend, like I was drugged.Â  Well I guess I did and I was!Â </p>
<p>Well the sickness started that&#8217;s for sure!Â Â  I was sick on Saturday before I moved wards&#8230;nice!Â  Then I was moved in my bed, think that gave me travel sickness &#8211; they could&#8217;ve warned me so I could put my ebay 99p travel sickness bands on! (they work a treat by the way, if you get travel sickness, get some!!)Â  Anyway, the nurses came and piled all my stuff into bags and onto trolleys and some onto my bed with me!Â  I couldn&#8217;t really move to help them as I was pretty dizzy and sicky and still attached to the friggin drip, pretty weird just lying there helplessly while they packed all my stuff up, I felt really bad!Â  But oh well!</p>
<p>Anna came to visit just after I&#8217;d moved&#8230;in fact she&#8217;s a lucky girl &#8211; she arrived as I was being sick in the toilet!!Â  I like to give all my visitors (or viewers!!Â  Sorry Robin!) a nice friendly welcome!!Â  It was lovely to see Anna as always but I just had to take it easy in bed as wasn&#8217;t feeling good.Â  Chris came too and my brother Robin and my parents, but it seems so long ago now I can&#8217;t even really remember the order&#8230;sorry guys!Â  Anyway there were all there which was the main thing.Â  I started to perk up throughout the afternoon.Â  I couldn&#8217;t really eat for ages, nothing tasted right and I felt sick&#8230;I had a concoction of drugs to try to prevent the sickness and extra injections too.Â  I&#8217;ve literally been like a pink cushion.Â  Since last Tuesday, less than a week, I&#8217;ve had 2 bone marrow biopsies taken, one from the top of each bum cheek!!Â  An injection in my belly, at least 3 or 4 injections in my arms, plus I think 4 different canulas in my hands/wrists to pump the drugs into my veins!Â  By the weekend I just had the &#8216;leave me alone&#8217; feeling&#8230;not to Chris or my friends or family (well, I hope, I may have said that, apparently the steroids I&#8217;m on will send my mind a bit ga ga &#8211; more than it already was!)&#8230;but to all the nurses and doctors who keep giving me tablets and injections and changing my drip, taking my blood pressure, temperature, weight, urine&#8230;blah blah blah!Â  I just wanted to lie in a dark room with no-one talking or touching me and to be left alone until this is all over.Â  I still feel like that a bit&#8230;of course I wish I could fall asleep and wake up in a year when this should all be over&#8230;I hope.Â  But I can&#8217;t.Â  So I&#8217;ll pipe down!</p>
<p>Anyway so Saturday came and went and I was okish by the evening and was looking forward to a fairly decent night&#8217;s sleep.Â  But then some comedy male &#8216;nurse&#8217; if you could call him that kept appearing!Â  He was japanese or chinese&#8230;well he was oriental.Â  Sorry if I offend anyone but I don&#8217;t actually know! Please excuse me for not checking his passport!Â  I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;s a lovely man and was only doing his job but he kept coming to see me in the night and asking me to pass urine!Â  You go pee?Â  You go pee?Â  YES I&#8217;VE BLOODY PEEED!Â  I&#8217;VE PEEED FOR 5 DAYS IN CARDBOARD PANS SO JUST LETÂ ME SLEEEEEEEEEEEEP!That&#8217;s whatÂ  I wanted to say.Â  I did not.Â  I restrained myself!Â  I really don&#8217;t think he was supposed to be encouraging me to pee quite so often though!Â  He looked more like a comedy film character than an NHS worker&#8230;a cross between Dumb and Dumber and Jackie Chan!!Â  He also couldn&#8217;t pronounce the sound &#8216;f&#8217; (he needs to do some phonics with me at school!)Â  I told him I should be ok to go home in the morning and he said &#8220;Keep your pingers crossed!&#8221;Â  HAHA pingers!Â  I&#8217;m not Pingu!Â  I remember thinking&#8230;&#8217;that would be funny if it wasn&#8217;t stupid o&#8217;clock in the morning and this random man hadn&#8217;t woken me up!&#8217;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sunday</span></strong></p>
<p>Sunday I was homeward bound&#8230;well I hoped to be.Â  I woke up and I was ok.Â  Apart from my oriental comedy character filled night&#8217;s sleep I was ok.Â  Well I was until I tried to move, or eat, or speak, or drink!Â  Or brush my teeth&#8230;that&#8217;s what tipped me over the edge and the sickness started again!Â  I kept saying to my mum and Chris yesterday that it just feels like the world&#8217;s worst hangover&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;imagine your WORST hangover&#8230;the WORST one&#8230;you feel sick, you&#8217;ve been sick, will you be sick again?Â  Your mouthÂ  feels like a manky old skunk or badger or some such creature has crawled into your mouth and done his business in your mouth (the nicest possible way I could think to phrase that!)Â  Your head is spinning from those shots that you thought were a good idea at the time!Â  You&#8217;re dizzy, light headed, hot and cold, achey, headache, nauseous&#8230;the lot.Â  NOW times that by about a million and make it last for DAYS and you&#8217;re nearly there!Â  Scary thought really as I guess it is similar in a way, my body&#8217;s been pumped full of poison (obviously in the hope to cure me, but in effect it&#8217;s poison) and I guess alcohol is poison inÂ a way (one that tastes good and gives you a good night admittedly!) and this is my body trying to recover from it.Â  Bizarre thought.Â </p>
<p>That&#8217;s the other weird thing though, that it&#8217;s not the cancer making me ill.Â  Anyone who&#8217;s seen me recently will know that.Â  I was fine.Â  My knee wasn&#8217;t even THAT bad.Â  It doesn&#8217;t even hurt right now.Â  HOW can it be CANCER?Â  &amp; how weird to know that it&#8217;s not the cancer making me ill, it&#8217;s the treatment.Â  Which I know everyone knows but when it&#8217;s actually happening to you and you actually think about it, it&#8217;s VERY odd.Â  They&#8217;re killing everything inside me just to kill the cancer in the tumour, before I can be better.</p>
<p>I keep wondering when my hair will come out.Â  To be fair I&#8217;ve felt so ill since Saturday I haven&#8217;t been able to wash it so my poor hair probably can&#8217;t wait to leave me &#8211; I&#8217;m not exactly taking care of it!Â  I almost want it to come out now.Â  I can understand why people shave it off.Â  BUT I don&#8217;t think I can.Â  I&#8217;ll just wait.Â  Highly bizarre though.Â  Strange how I used to hate my hair and now I love it.Â  Please don&#8217;t moan about your hair&#8230;you have hair&#8230;full stop.Â  &amp; you all have lovely hair&#8230;I&#8217;ve heard all your hair gripes and you&#8217;ve all heard mine.Â  I won&#8217;t embarrass you but you know who you are&#8230;your fringe is lovely, no it&#8217;s not too long or too short!Â  No your hair&#8217;s not boring, you don&#8217;t look like a boy!Â  No your grey hairs don&#8217;t show.Â  It&#8217;s not too light, no nor too dark.Â  No it doesn&#8217;t look red.Â  Yes I love it!!Â  I love all of your hair!! (donations for wigs accepted!)Â  I&#8217;m JOKING!Â  PLEASE DO NOT CUT OFF YOUR HAIR FOR ME!!</p>
<p>Right anyway so Sunday Chris and my mum came to get me quite early in the morning as I thought I was ok and free to go when I wanted to.Â  But then it was while they were on their way that I got sick.Â  It was a rubbish day and I felt bad on them&#8230;my dad also came later on. <em>It took til after 7pm untilÂ I was OK to leave!Â  Ooops!</em>Â  I did have extra injections which they said could make me tired, dizzy etc. and hell they did!Â  Everyone thought I was asleep and I sort of was but at the same time I could hear them talking and what was going on but I couldn&#8217;t move or speak or anything.Â  I know that sounds melodramatic but it really was surreal.Â  There was another comedy &#8216;nurse&#8217; &#8230;an indian guy.Â  Again I&#8217;m sure he was lovely really but I&#8217;d had enough and again he just seemed to be acting like some random bloke you&#8217;d find in American Pie!Â  He was dithering and dathering and asking the same questions over and over again&#8230;I&#8217;ll stop now as I&#8217;ll get bitchy but he was hard work!</p>
<p>Anyway Sunday was a haze of sleep and sick and dizziness.Â  Eventually got to the car (with my huge bag of medication to take home &amp; a car load of my stuff!) &amp; I managed to make it all the way home&#8230;nearly!Â  We got near to Bramshill I think and I was only bloody sick.Â  Lovely.Â  Typical.Â  I always did that as a kid with travel sickness!Â  Nice!Â </p>
<p>Anyway will cut this short now as I&#8217;m dizzy.Â  Sorry to people who I haven&#8217;t responded to the last few days.Â  It&#8217;s beenÂ a total haze of sickness, weakness and dizziness.Â  Today I&#8217;ve stayed in bed.Â  I do want to see you all but today&#8217;s not a good day.Â  Today is a RED day for those of you who understand traffic lights!Â  I&#8217;ve also been instructed to do nothing and to avoid people with colds.Â  Again, it&#8217;s NOT that I don&#8217;t want to see you but if you do have a cold or anything please stay away for me.Â  I&#8217;m VERY likely to get infections and end up in A&amp;E this week so I want to minimise that as much as possible.</p>
<p>Now I must have a bath.Â  It&#8217;s been a while&#8230;!Â  Will write more soon.Â  Love you all xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</p>

		<p>OK, now I won&#8217;t write loads but as I had to do Thursday in hindsight, I don&#8217;t want to get really behind!Â  Yesterday (Friday) was better.Â  I had chemo changes all night but then in the morning after the last change I managed to get some more sleep which I really needed.Â  My mum and dad came back and Linda and Barry came too (Chris&#8217;s parents)Â  It was lovely to see them all but not sure how lovely it is for people to see me!!Â  I&#8217;ve been really swollen and puffy&#8230;attractive!Â  I&#8217;ve only gone and put on weight!Â  But no, before you think it, I&#8217;m not the only person ever to defy medical science and put weight ON during chemo!!Â  They say it&#8217;s normal and expected, it&#8217;s from all the fluid being pumped into me and also the steroids&#8230;so they keep giving me something to make me pee more!Â  I just love being made to pee MORE when have to wheel my stupid chemo trolley across to the toilet, write my bed number onto a cardboard pan and leave my pee to be collected to be measured and tested!Â  Yes everytime!Â  When I get home I won&#8217;t know what to do &#8211; I&#8217;ll be asking Chris to collect it!!Â  No. not REALLY!</p>
<p>Sickness&#8230;</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t actually been sick yet but that&#8217;s probs cos I&#8217;m on SOOOOOO many anti-sickness drugs it&#8217;s ridiculous!!Â  Am feeling sick though right now, when I have the 4 different chemo drugs all in a row it makes me feel sick&#8230;&amp; my tastebuds are changing which they also warned me about!Â  Seem to change throughout the day though, think depends what&#8217;s been drip, drip, dripping into me!Â  But yesterday OJ tasted like acid, a plain roll tasted like metal and pringles I&#8217;m sure were covered in iron filings!Â  In fact I can&#8217;t even type about food, my stomach&#8217;s turning&#8230;</p>
<p>So Friday night, Chris came fairly early so we had about an hour together alone which was lovely.Â  He brought me some cookies and cupcakes and they didn&#8217;t taste like metal!!Â  Phew!!Â  Then Anna arrived, followed by Ollie and Laura.Â  It was lovely to see all of them and I felt quite calm and relaxed.Â  We just chatted as normal really&#8230;.well remember normal now isn&#8217;t what normal used to be!Â  Anna got me some lovely pressies (Thank you!!) and even made me a Little Miss Scamp Mr Men card and made TEAM SCAMP wrapping paper!Â  Pink of course&#8230;very cool!Â  Ollie had set up my pretty new laptop and installed everything I needed.Â  She&#8217;s just so shiny!Â  Not sure why I&#8217;m referring to it as a person &#8211; Laura that&#8217;s your fault!!</p>
<p>Right I&#8217;m going to pipe down now, don&#8217;t feel too good,Â  It&#8217;s Sat morning and I feel sick and weak.Â  The ward&#8217;s practically empty now as most peeps gone home.Â  I have to move to the long stay ward around lunchtime.Â  The nurse asked me when the removal van is coming!Â  My dad asked the same!Â  They know me too well!Â  I don&#8217;t have THAT much stuff!</p>
<p>Today Anna&#8217;s coming back this morning and Chris is coming around lunchtime and Robin my bro is coming sometime (when he&#8217;s up!!)Â  My parents might come too but think they deserve a rest really!Â  Robin asked me on the phone the other day about the &#8216;viewing&#8217; times!!Â  Simple mistake &#8211; he of course meant visiting times but made me chuckle, sounds like a zoo!Â  I wish IÂ WAS at the zoo&#8230;!xxx</p>

		<p>Well, sorry I disappeared for a while, can&#8217;t believe how many messages and emails I got asking what had happened to my website!!</p>
<p>Thursday was a bad night&#8230;a low moment&#8230;or several!!!Â  Must&#8217;ve been a bad omen that this website was down for a while, think I had sympathy pains for it!!Â  Thanks Ollie for sorting the site out!Â  Oooh by the way, in case anyone&#8217;s interested I&#8217;m now typing (still with one hand, bloody canula!!) on a brand new, very posh PINK laptop!!Â  She&#8217;s so pretty!! I&#8217;ve already got a reputation at the hospital for &#8216;pink&#8217; and making myself at home!!Â  I have been here ALL week though, longer than anyone else&#8230;</p>
<p>Anyway, back to Thursday&#8230;it wasn&#8217;t ALL bad.Â  I was fine during the day&#8230;well when I say &#8216;fine&#8217; it has a very different meaning to what being fine used to mean!!Â  I think by the evening I was just so exhausted that it was bound to all catch up with me.Â  My mum and dad were with me for the afternoon then Chris got here as soon as he could then Gemma (Walton), Chris (Otterway) and Dave cameÂ  in the evening after having missed the exit on the way here&#8230;twice!!Â  I felt really bad as I&#8217;d just had my first tears since I&#8217;d been here and wasn&#8217;t nice for them to arrive to after coming all that way.Â  I&#8217;d just had the stuff syringed in to stop me reacting to the chemo I&#8217;d reacted toÂ and it reaaaaaaally hurt!!Â  Anyway, we went out onto the roof garden (I am in hospital honestly, I&#8217;m not just in hiding at some luxurious retreat! I wish!)Â  I managed to pull myself together to enjoy them being here and then after they&#8217;d gone Chris went soon after.Â  My parents stayed to make sure the next lot of chemo went in ok but I think probably because the nurse was being kind and had disconnected me for so long to have some time out, it was agony when they tried to go back in and that just set me off&#8230;</p>
<p>All the things that the professionals, the leaflets and the websites tell you that you&#8217;ll feel starting coming out of my mouth&#8230;without me even realising they&#8217;ve been hidden inside me&#8230;the devestation: I can&#8217;t believe it, it must be a dream (a nightmare!),&#8230;the anger: why me? What have I done?Â  I&#8217;m so young for this to be happening&#8230;denial: my knee&#8217;s barely even hurting at the moment, how can it possibly be cancer??&#8230;the frustration: I just want everyone to leave me alone and stop poking and pricking and pumping this poison into me.Â  I just want to be at home with Chris and be &#8216;normal&#8217; again!Â  I really am missing worrying about trivial things but I just can&#8217;t seem to be annoyed or worried about any of the little things that seemed so important before.Â  Lastly, the worst feelings coming out was fear: What if I don&#8217;t make it?Â  What if the chemo doesn&#8217;t work?&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;anyway I can&#8217;t think like that and I won&#8217;t think like that but before that night I had surprised myself so much (and some of you I think?!) with my positivity&#8230;and some of you might think it was an act but it honestly wasn&#8217;t!Â  I couldn&#8217;t believe how naturally positive I was feeling and behaving&#8230;I was just scared it would run out and when I got so low on Thursday I felt like I&#8217;d let myself and everyone else down (teacher talk!!)Â  I was sad for my mum and dad for having to hear all those negative things from me&#8230; I was so scared that I felt physically and emotionally as though I&#8217;d hit rock bottom but knowing that I&#8217;m still soooooooooo far off that&#8230;I haven&#8217;t even been sick yet or llost my hair and this is only round one of many&#8230;</p>
<p>So anyway, now I feel like my positivity is coming and going in waves&#8230;so sometimes it may be a bit of an act, but it&#8217;s either that or give up and I&#8217;m not ready to do that xxx</p>
