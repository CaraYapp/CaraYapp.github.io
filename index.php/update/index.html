		<p>As promised, I&#8217;m back!  Sooner than last time!  It&#8217;s now 2 weeks since my op and I&#8217;ve been in this room for 2 weeks and 1 day!  Enough to drive anyone insane but I&#8217;m still with you!  Just about!  The poor old lady in the room next door to me doesn&#8217;t have a clue who she is or where she is!  She shouts and screams all night (which is great fun for me!) then sleeps all day!  She asks the nurses if she was here earlier when she&#8217;s been here for weeks.  I hobbled past on my crutches the other evening and she was trying to get me to go in and help her!  I think she thought I was a nurse!  That&#8217;d be interesting, a nurse in pyjamas who can&#8217;t walk!  I don&#8217;t think the NHS are that desperate yet!</p>
<p>Anyway I&#8217;ve continued to make slow but steady progress.  On Tuesday morning  I passed the stair test!  Which involved going up and down some practice stairs with just 3 steps on them.  Not quite the same as tackling the stairs at home but at least I&#8217;ve got the technique!  I&#8217;ve got faster on my crutches, although still have to have leg in the splint and is still hard work.  My &#8216;dog lead&#8217; is amazing!  Very clever little tool so I can pick my leg up myself to get on and off the bed.  One problem though&#8230;it&#8217;s blue.  BLUE?!!  I need a pink fluffy one!  Another problem&#8230;there&#8217;s no way it would fit around a St Bernard&#8217;s neck!  Oh well, guess my leg will have to be my only pet for the moment!  I&#8217;ve also got another new toy called a helping hand which looks like a litter picker!  It&#8217;s so I can pick this up and to help me get dressed myself!</p>
<p>Tomorrow morning I&#8217;ve got to go over to the other hospital (The Churchill, which is the cancer centre where I have my chemo) for my appointment with Prof, where we&#8217;ll find out the results from the lab and the plan for the next stages of chemo.  It&#8217;ll be really good to know what the next steps are as this is the first time since the start that I don&#8217;t have a plan to work towards.  Then after my appointment I get to go home!  YAY!  I have to be back on Monday for chemo which is rubbish but at least I get to go home for the weekend.  I&#8217;m going to go to my parents for the weekend as I think it&#8217;ll be easier to manage there and our house is just full of boxes at the moment anyway!  We&#8217;re hoping for next week for the house move but<em> </em>it&#8217;s still not confirmed yet.  So hopefully I&#8217;ll come out of chemo into the new house but who knows!  I just have to take everything one day at a time at the moment, as I have for the last 5 months.</p>
<p>Well that&#8217;s all for now&#8230;thanks to all my faithful bloggers, I love reading your comments!  I know lots of people are reading but not commenting&#8230;please leave a comment so I know who you are!! </p>
<p>Lots of love xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</p>
