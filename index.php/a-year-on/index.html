		<div>Hello and sorry for my lack of blogging recently&#8230;Do I have any readers left?!  An update&#8230;after over a year since my cancer diagnosis&#8230;</div>
<div>So the last few months for me have been &#8216;recovery&#8217; time for me &amp; I&#8217;m as impatient as ever to get back to &#8216;normal&#8217;&#8230;whatever that means!  I&#8217;m striving to get my life back to some kind of &#8216;normality&#8217; where everyday things are more of a concern than hair growth, physio and surviving!  I&#8217;m getting there but it&#8217;s harder than I ever imagined and I really think that the part when treatment&#8217;s over is massively underestimated and more difficult phycially and emotionally than anyone would think.  I sometimes feel I should be able to pick up where I left off before cancer knocked me off my feet &amp; took me on this crazy rollercoaster ride.  Now I&#8217;ve been dropped off the rollercoaster I have to find my feet again somehow.  Anyway it&#8217;s early days and I&#8217;m trying to just enjoy life and take it easy.  My immune system&#8217;s still ridiculously low and at the moment I&#8217;m back in bed poorly with a sinus infection &amp; being sick.  I&#8217;m so sick &amp; tired of feeling sick &amp; tired!  There should be some justice in the world &#8211; if you have cancer and go through so much chemotherapy it should give you some kind of free pass to never get poorly again!! If only! </div>
<div>Anyway, as I said, the happiest news in a long time is our engagement &amp; the surprise proposal so we&#8217;re now starting to plan our wedding for August 2011!  It&#8217;s weird because obviously I&#8217;m SO happy and there were plenty of times I couldn&#8217;t ever imagine getting to this point and didn&#8217;t know if I&#8217;d even be here to be getting married.  But it&#8217;s kind of bittersweet because at the same time I&#8217;m dreading trying wedding dresses on because of the lack of hair on my head and the extra weight I can&#8217;t shift from all the steroids I was on and lack of exercise I&#8217;ve had since surgery.  I never really imagined trying wedding dresses on with wigs &amp; the fact that I have to makes me so angry with the cancer for doing that to me.  But then I think, at the end of the day, what&#8217;s hair?!!  It&#8217;s so unimportant in the grand scheme of things that I then beat myself up for even worrying about it!  I guess that&#8217;s part of getting back to &#8216;normal&#8217; though, thinks like the state of my hair and the size of my bum becoming the biggest things I have to worry about, rather than whether your stay alive, get through your next cycle of chemo or ever walk again!  Girls&#8230;we&#8217;re never happy!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Anyway, although this period of time is proving to be harder than I maybe expected, it&#8217;s still a hell of a lot better than this time last year, however you look at it!  I&#8217;ve just been on holiday with Chris and all my family &#8211; mum, dad, sister, brother in law, 3 nieces and my brother for part of it.  It was lovely to get away, to spend some time together and to see the sunshine.  We went to La Gomera, an island in the Canary Islands that noone&#8217;s ever heard of!  Due to the volcanic ash we got stuck there nearly a week longer than we&#8217;d planned.  It was a strange experience and it all went a bit crazy with everyone trying to get on flights or find random ways of getting home!  My brother paid hundreds of Euros to fly to Barcelona, spend 2 nights there and the fly to Milan and eventually to London&#8230;.the main reason he wanted to get back was to play football in a cup final!!  I would expect nothing less from Robin!  My brother in law needed to get back for his twin brother&#8217;s wedding, so as soon as UK airspace opened, he booked himself on a flight to Manchester and then travelled back down south with his parents.  The rest of us waited until the next available flight could take us straight home as planned.  So me, Chris, my sister and her 3 girls flew back on the Saturday night, a late flight but we didn&#8217;t have much choice!  Little did we know, about an hour and a half into the flight, the pilot would pipe up with an announcement that we&#8217;re going via Malaga to pick up stranded passengers!!  All very random and a longer journey than planned but we eventually arrived home at 4am Sunday morning, after leaving where we were staying at 3pm Saturday!  A long journey for a short distance!   It was all a mad panic for some people and for lots it just seemed like a disaster and the worst thing that had ever happened to them, especially when watching Sky News or BBC News 24/7 for updates!  I guess for lots of people maybe that is the worst thing that&#8217;s happened to them&#8230;but being stuck on a beautiful island in the sunshine, with free accommodation (the place said we could stay free of charge as we were stuck) isn&#8217;t exactly disastrous in my book!  I know it was worse for families with children who needed to be back at school and for people who needed to get back to work and were losing money by not getting home &amp; maybe it&#8217;s easy for me to say that it wasn&#8217;t so bad!  But I just couldn&#8217;t stop thinking about &#8216;this time last year&#8217; and there was no comparison!  The day we were due to fly back was 20th April 2010.  On 20th April 2009 I was told I had cancer.  I was told I&#8217;d need at least a year off work.  I was told I&#8217;d lose my hair.  I was told I&#8217;d probably be left infertile from the chemo and there was no time to harvest eggs because it was a life or death risk if we didn&#8217;t start chemo immediately.  Basically I was told that my life as I knew it was over.  Now, being told that, or getting stuck on holiday&#8230;hmmmmm it&#8217;s a tricky one but I know which I&#8217;d choose everytime! &#8230;</div>
<div> I feel like I&#8217;m always going to feel like this in any &#8216;bad&#8217; situation&#8230;where for some people it could seem awful, I&#8217;ll always be thinking &#8216;oh well, at least you haven&#8217;t got cancer&#8217; &#8230;sometimes I feel like a total bitch for thinking like that and sometimes I keep my thoughts to myself to spare other people&#8217;s feelings!  But even if someone had broken their leg for example (a story I heard recently of one of Chris&#8217;s football team) &#8211; he has to have operations and can&#8217;t exercise for 6 months&#8230;.all I could think was &#8216;OH WELL!&#8217;  It&#8217;s hardly the end of the world!  I guess that&#8217;s the thing about experiencing &#8216;the worst&#8217;, you can only appreciate something being not too bad if you&#8217;ve experienced something much worse.  I&#8217;m sure for that footballer, breaking his leg seems like the worst thing possible, but me and many others know first hand that it&#8217;s not!</div>
<div>Since my &#8216;one year cancer anniversary&#8217; has passed, I&#8217;ve been doing a lot of &#8216;this time last year&#8217; thinking.  I know it might not be helpful for me but I can&#8217;t help it and thinking back is almost like going through it all over again.  It&#8217;s made me more emotional again and made me realise that I don&#8217;t think the realisation of &#8216;I&#8217;ve had cancer&#8217; will ever become normal, no matter how much you think you&#8217;ve got it in check, it always has the power to come out from nowhere and smack you in the face (or the leg!) again and knock you down as if you&#8217;ve gone right back to the day of diagnosis.  It&#8217;s not pleasant and it never stops being shocking.  But at least I can now find myself saying &#8216;I HAD cancer&#8217; not &#8216;I&#8217;ve GOT cancer&#8217;, something which took quite some adjusting to!  Anyway this time last year, on this day, I had just arrived home from my first chemo session.  I had been in hospital in Oxford for nearly a week having the chemo and then feeling well enough and stopping puking long enough to face the journey home!  It was a sunny day (some kind of miracle for a bank holiday!) and as we drove back through Fleet to get to our house at the time, the pubs &amp; restaurants and streets were full of people out eating, drinking and enjoying the freedom of a Sunday night out without a Monday morning at work.  I&#8217;ve never ever and I hope I never will again, been so overwhelmed with the feeling of anger and jealousy.  I should have been out enjoying myself.  I was 26, it was May Bank Holiday.  What the hell was happening to me?  I went straight up to bed surrounded by sick bowls and we had the windows open as it was hot (again, a miracle for Bank Holiday!)  I remember so clearly lying there feeling worse than I could ever  imagine feeling (little did I know it would get much worse over the coming months!) and I could hear people in neighbouring gardens laughing and drinking.  I assume they were having a BBQ with friends or family and why not?  It&#8217;s Bank Holiday Sunday and it&#8217;s warm and sunny enough to sit outside.  I didn&#8217;t think that at the time.  I can remember ALL I could think was &#8216;WHAT are they laughing at?&#8217;  They just seemed to be laughing and laughing and laughing and I remember thinking &#8216; what could POSSIBLY be funny?&#8217;  &#8216;What is there to laugh about?&#8217;  Anyone who knows me will know that I ALWAYS find something to laugh about&#8230;often things that noone else would laugh about!!  But at that time I just could not imagine ever laughing again.  I&#8217;ve got cancer, I&#8217;m on chemo, I&#8217;m losing my hair, I&#8217;m sicker than I could ever imagine, I might lose my leg, I might lose my life.  WHAT could possibly ever make me laugh again?  The truth is, lots of things made me laugh again.  Even things in hospital, even things involving my sickness, my hair loss and my dodgy leg.  Because if you can&#8217;t laugh, what can you do?!  So at least tonight, even though it&#8217;s Bank Holiday Sunday and I&#8217;m yet again home feeling poorly while everyone else is out drinking (this time even Chris is out drinking!), at least</div>
<div>1) I&#8217;m still here</div>
<div>2) I can laugh (&amp; will laugh lots when I watch a chick flick in a minute, with no Chris to moan about what I&#8217;m watching and want to put some boy film or the football on!)</div>
<div>3) I can say I HAD cancer, not I&#8217;ve GOT cancer</div>
<div>4) I&#8217;ve got short horrible boy/lesbian hair but at least it&#8217;s growing &amp; not falling out</div>
<div>5) We have a much bigger house &amp; even if I did have the windows open, I wouldn&#8217;t hear the neighbours laughing all night!</div>
<div>&#8230;unfortunately though it&#8217;s cold and it&#8217;s raining and last year&#8217;s miracle weather for May Bank Holiday has not been repeated!!!!  You can&#8217;t have everything though!</div>
<div>
<div>Me being poorly again now just goes to show how low my immune system is&#8230; I&#8217;m so bored of feeling poorly and taking it easy and being reminded to rest all the time.  I just want to live again and be some kind of &#8216;normal&#8217;!  Anyway I will get there, I just need to give myself time and be patient I guess.  I&#8217;m waiting to hear about my return to work as a primary school teacher.  I&#8217;m hoping I can start back on a phased return in September&#8230;something that sometimes excites me and sometimes petrifies me!  Time will tell though, what will be will be.  I&#8217;m due to fly to Portugal early Tuesday morning with a good friend &amp; one of my bridesmaids, Gemma, and Lou another good friend &amp; bridesmaid is joining us on Saturday.  It&#8217;s been touch &amp; go whether I&#8217;ll make it though as I&#8217;ve been in bed for days, with my only trip out being to the doctors.  I&#8217;m feeling alot better today though and hoping to be even better tomorrow and ok to fly by Tuesday morning&#8230;cross your fingers for me.  I&#8217;m looking forward to some more sunshine and some time away with Gemma &amp; Lou but just wish I&#8217;d had longer at home to rest between holidays&#8230;pesky volcanic ash!  Anyway I&#8217;m sure we won&#8217;t do much once we&#8217;re there&#8230;sunbathing and&#8230;well, sunbathing!!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We have no further news in terms of my fertility and again I suppose it&#8217;s early days and I need to be patient.  I just wish I could see the future and know if everything&#8217;s going to be ok though.  My desperation to be a mum only increases all the time though.  On holiday with us were my 3 nieces who are 7, 5 and 2 and I absolutely adore.  I spent loads of time with them and after being with them everyday for nearly 3 weeks, I long to be a mum more than ever.  It&#8217;s made me more and more emotional about it and it&#8217;s on my mind all the time.  I know there&#8217;s nothing I can do and time will tell and everyone keeps reminding me, it was more important to keep me alive than to protect my fertility.  As logical as all that is though and I know it&#8217;s true, it doesn&#8217;t make it any easier to accept it and I don&#8217;t think I ever will.  I will never give up hope though and have heard many amazing, inspirational stories that give me the hope to cling to.  I know I need to be more patient and I forget it&#8217;s only been 2 months since I finished chemo so I need to stop being so hard on myself and give my body and my mind the time it needs!</div>
<div>I&#8217;ve recently heard about Lisa Lynch, who had breast cancer at 28.  She&#8217;s now 30 and she was in Glamour magazine.  She has a blog <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.alrighttit.com" target="_blank">www.alrighttit.com</a> !! &amp; has just had her book published &#8211; The C-Word.  I haven&#8217;t read her book yet as I only got it today, but have been reading some of her blog and she&#8217;s very funny &amp; witty and I can relate to alot of it, although it&#8217;s a totally different cancer, there are lots of similarities.</div>
<div>On Saturday 29th May I&#8217;m having a pink (of course!) party &amp; fundraiser, to celebrate the end of my treatment and to raise money for Cancer Research, Bone Cancer Research Trust, Sarcoma uUK and Macmillan.  It&#8217;s at our house in Fleet in Hampshire.  If anyone&#8217;s interested in coming, please contact me at <a href="mailto:cara_yapp@yahoo.co.uk">cara_yapp@yahoo.co.uk</a> for further details.  Or if anyone has any fundraising ideas or can donate raffle prizes to help us raise money, please get in touch.</div>
<div>Thanks for reading &amp; happy bank holiday xxx</div>
<div>Oooh, how could I forget &#8211; some important news from holiday!</div>
<div>I didn&#8217;t wear a wig at all on holiday and spent 3 weeks &#8216;baring&#8217; my head and newly growing hair!  With just headscarves at night&#8230;</div>
<div>The hair on my legs grew back bigtime (great!) and in desperation to get rid of it, we ventured to the local chemist in the nearest village on the island and managed to buy some Veet!  I hadn&#8217;t used a razor, wax or hair removal cream for a year&#8230;it was kind of  nice to need it but kind of a pain!</div>
<div>There were hundreds of steps where we were staying so having to do them everyday was great physio and I can now do stairs normally which I couldn&#8217;t do before holiday!</div>
<div>I still managed to tan, despite having to use high factor and be careful in the sun as the chemo leaves your skin sensitive to the sun for at least 6 months&#8230;</div>
