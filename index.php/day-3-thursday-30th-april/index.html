		<p>Well, sorry I disappeared for a while, can&#8217;t believe how many messages and emails I got asking what had happened to my website!!</p>
<p>Thursday was a bad night&#8230;a low moment&#8230;or several!!!  Must&#8217;ve been a bad omen that this website was down for a while, think I had sympathy pains for it!!  Thanks Ollie for sorting the site out!  Oooh by the way, in case anyone&#8217;s interested I&#8217;m now typing (still with one hand, bloody canula!!) on a brand new, very posh PINK laptop!!  She&#8217;s so pretty!! I&#8217;ve already got a reputation at the hospital for &#8216;pink&#8217; and making myself at home!!  I have been here ALL week though, longer than anyone else&#8230;</p>
<p>Anyway, back to Thursday&#8230;it wasn&#8217;t ALL bad.  I was fine during the day&#8230;well when I say &#8216;fine&#8217; it has a very different meaning to what being fine used to mean!!  I think by the evening I was just so exhausted that it was bound to all catch up with me.  My mum and dad were with me for the afternoon then Chris got here as soon as he could then Gemma (Walton), Chris (Otterway) and Dave came  in the evening after having missed the exit on the way here&#8230;twice!!  I felt really bad as I&#8217;d just had my first tears since I&#8217;d been here and wasn&#8217;t nice for them to arrive to after coming all that way.  I&#8217;d just had the stuff syringed in to stop me reacting to the chemo I&#8217;d reacted to and it reaaaaaaally hurt!!  Anyway, we went out onto the roof garden (I am in hospital honestly, I&#8217;m not just in hiding at some luxurious retreat! I wish!)  I managed to pull myself together to enjoy them being here and then after they&#8217;d gone Chris went soon after.  My parents stayed to make sure the next lot of chemo went in ok but I think probably because the nurse was being kind and had disconnected me for so long to have some time out, it was agony when they tried to go back in and that just set me off&#8230;</p>
<p>All the things that the professionals, the leaflets and the websites tell you that you&#8217;ll feel starting coming out of my mouth&#8230;without me even realising they&#8217;ve been hidden inside me&#8230;the devestation: I can&#8217;t believe it, it must be a dream (a nightmare!),&#8230;the anger: why me? What have I done?  I&#8217;m so young for this to be happening&#8230;denial: my knee&#8217;s barely even hurting at the moment, how can it possibly be cancer??&#8230;the frustration: I just want everyone to leave me alone and stop poking and pricking and pumping this poison into me.  I just want to be at home with Chris and be &#8216;normal&#8217; again!  I really am missing worrying about trivial things but I just can&#8217;t seem to be annoyed or worried about any of the little things that seemed so important before.  Lastly, the worst feelings coming out was fear: What if I don&#8217;t make it?  What if the chemo doesn&#8217;t work?&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;anyway I can&#8217;t think like that and I won&#8217;t think like that but before that night I had surprised myself so much (and some of you I think?!) with my positivity&#8230;and some of you might think it was an act but it honestly wasn&#8217;t!  I couldn&#8217;t believe how naturally positive I was feeling and behaving&#8230;I was just scared it would run out and when I got so low on Thursday I felt like I&#8217;d let myself and everyone else down (teacher talk!!)  I was sad for my mum and dad for having to hear all those negative things from me&#8230; I was so scared that I felt physically and emotionally as though I&#8217;d hit rock bottom but knowing that I&#8217;m still soooooooooo far off that&#8230;I haven&#8217;t even been sick yet or llost my hair and this is only round one of many&#8230;</p>
<p>So anyway, now I feel like my positivity is coming and going in waves&#8230;so sometimes it may be a bit of an act, but it&#8217;s either that or give up and I&#8217;m not ready to do that xxx</p>
