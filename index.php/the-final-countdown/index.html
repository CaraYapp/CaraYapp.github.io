		<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Back again&#8230;I haven&#8217;t been writing as much recently as I haven&#8217;t been feeling as well and also because with so few comments I tended to think noone was reading anymore!  But I have recently heard of lots of people reading via other people so I guess I&#8217;ll assume someone&#8217;s reading this and keep writing!  Let me know if you are reading!  Even if you don&#8217;t want to write a public comment on here, you can always email me at <a href="mailto:cara_yapp@yahoo.co.uk">cara_yapp@yahoo.co.uk</a>&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m back on the cancer ward and I&#8217;ve almost come full circle.  It feels very strange as I&#8217;m in a bay of 4 beds, not in my usual separate room.  Although it&#8217;s not the same bay, my bed is in the same corner of the bay that it was for my very first chemo so I can&#8217;t help but think back&#8230;I can hear the all too familiar sound of some poor chap being violently sick and it brings back so many awful memories over the past 10 months&#8230;</p>
<p>Well, on Friday I had my usual scheduled appointment with Prof to review things and to have my usual pre chemo blood checks etc.  My picc line, however, decided to give up on me and would not flush and was blocked.  It was decided it would have to be taken out.  After an already emotional morning of mixed thoughts and feelings about everything, this did not help.  Then, on meeting with Prof and the nurses I got very upset and couldn&#8217;t really explain why.  It&#8217;s just the  sheer exhaustion and pure emotion that comes from nearly a year of such a gruelling treatment regime&#8230;and also all the worries, concerns and anxieties that come when you&#8217;re thinking about getting your life back.  I also haven&#8217;t been feeling as well since my last chemo, nothing major compared to previous episodes but just not feeling right.  Basically Prof said I&#8217;m physically and emotionally exhausted from it all and it&#8217;s surprising that I&#8217;ve come this far and lasted this long.  He also said the way I&#8217;ve coped physically with the treatment I&#8217;ve had has been like an 18 year old!  I was very happy with that!  Shame my body doesn&#8217;t LOOK like an 18 year old&#8217;s!  Especially not with all the weight I&#8217;ve put on from the steroids and the immobility post surgery.   Anyway so basically he said maybe it&#8217;s time to call it a day.  I really didn&#8217;t know what to say, not knowing how I feel and having such mixed feelings about it.  It&#8217;s so hard when nobody knows what&#8217;s best and noone can make the decision but me.  There&#8217;s no evidence to suggest that prolonging the maintenance chemo I&#8217;m on at the moment will have any benefit.  Basically nobody knows what&#8217;s best.  But he did say having or not having one extra will not make any difference and the benefit won&#8217;t outway the damage it&#8217;s doing to me so he said we&#8217;d make a deal and I&#8217;d do this one more and this will be my last one.  Just wanting to be told what to do, I agreed with very mixed feelings and very emotional&#8230;</p>
<p>So here I am waiting for my last chemo to begin.  After sitting and waiting for 7 hours I was told at about 7 pm this evening that I wouldn&#8217;t start until tomorrow!  It&#8217;s a long story but I&#8217;m just being patient and being a good girl and so what if I&#8217;ll be in an extra night, I&#8217;ve done well over 100 nights in hospital in the past 10 months so I can do a few more!  &amp; before the chemo starts someone&#8217;s got to manage to get a canula into me now that my picc line&#8217;s gone!  &amp; my veins are NOT easy to find!</p>
<p>Anyway I had a lovely weekend as I took Chris away on a surprise weekend in the Cotswolds for 2 nights and then to a lovely hotel nearer to Oxford.  We did lots of fun things&#8230;dinners, lunches&#8230;not just eating though&#8230;cinema, a maze, a model village, the zoo, shopping (sorry Chris!) and lots of relaxing and walking in the pretty villages.  My leg&#8217;s paying for it now (well I am!) as I&#8217;ve walked so much, it&#8217;s really painful again now.  Good job I&#8217;m being forced to rest in hospital now.  I&#8217;ve come to realise the last few days that I&#8217;ve actually just got use to being in constant pain and I can&#8217;t remember what it&#8217;s like not to be in pain.  Since surgery, I literally have been in pain non stop.  &amp; that&#8217;s draining in itself but I count it as the least of my worries.  I still stand by what I&#8217;ve said before, that I&#8217;m so lucky to have kept my leg so no matter how painful or frustrating my leg is, I try not to complain as I keep myself in check thinking of those not as fortunate at me.  In fact I&#8217;m talking to a guy at the moment on facebook who I&#8217;ve got in contact with as he also had Ewing&#8217;s Sarcoma and unfortunately had to have his leg amputated.  I find it really helps me to talk to other people in similar situations as me, to compare notes so to speak!  I&#8217;ve also this evening met a guy on the ward who also has Ewing&#8217;s Sarcoma but not in the bone, in the soft tissue around his stomach.  It&#8217;s crazy that it&#8217;s something so so rare and I&#8217;ve spoken to 2 young guys with it within a few hours!  I also met another guy who had a similar cancer to me in a similar place and had the same surgery.  We&#8217;d been talking online and we met a few weeks ago at a new Sarcoma Support Group being run by the Macmillan Nurses at the hospital.  He finished his chemo in September and it was really good to meet him and see how well he&#8217;s doing and again to chat about our experiences.  It makes you realise, even if you have the same or similar things, just how different everyone&#8217;s experience is.  It&#8217;s a great reminder that you&#8217;re not the only one going through it aswell, which it can sometimes feel like&#8230;also a reminder to count your blessings and always to think about why I&#8217;m lucky not why I&#8217;m unlucky. Not always easy but hey&#8230;</p>
<p>Anyway so that&#8217;s my latest&#8230;I know you&#8217;ll all be reading thinking, great, yippee, wahoo, last chemo!  Unfortunately I seem to be yet to feel that way.  To be honest my head feels pretty messed up and I don&#8217;t understand a lot of what I&#8217;m feeling right now.  It&#8217;s as if I don&#8217;t want to stop chemo which is very backwards!  It&#8217;s partly the fear of stopping and not having treatment any longer, which fuels the fear of the cancer recurring.  Also it&#8217;s the fact that for such a long time I&#8217;ve lived by such a strict cycle and that will stop.  I&#8217;ve also forged some really strong relationships with so many of the staff, I feel sad to lose them.  All I&#8217;ve known for so long is cancer and all I&#8217;ve been is a cancer patient and that will suddenly stop.  I feel this pressure (not from anyone, just myself!) to be able to pick up where I left off before this evil disease struck, which is physically impossible to do.  I feel lost.  I feel like I don&#8217;t know who I am anymore even though all my friends and  loved ones say I haven&#8217;t changed a bit and am still the same.  I feel like I&#8217;ve changed though, I couldn&#8217;t tell you how or explain what I mean exactly but I know I&#8217;ll never be the same person I was before.  I feel alot has been taken away from me.  Any innocence I had about life has gone.  I&#8217;ve seen and felt the worst I could imagine and I find it alot harder to daydream now and imagine my life being mapped out like a fairytale!  I know all this is just real life and that comes with growing up anyway&#8230;but it&#8217;s usually a lot more gradual than having a bombshell like cancer dropped on you at 26!  Physically I feel like I&#8217;ve been chucked on a rollercoaster which hasn&#8217;t stopped for nearly a year, making me sick, ripping out my hair, making a huge scar on my leg, removing my bone and replacing it with metal, screwing with every emotion I have inside and now the rollercoaster&#8217;s about to chuck me out and drop me from a great height, ready to face the world again?!  I think alot of my anxieties also stem from the feeling that I&#8217;ve been a patient and been cared for and treated for so long that all I&#8217;ve had to do is lie back and take it and be patient and put up with all the illness, sickness, waiting, etc. etc. I say &#8216;all&#8217; but I don&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s been easy as that would be lying!  It&#8217;s been the hardest thing I&#8217;ve ever done without a doubt.  But I&#8217;ve had unbelievably amazing support and care and love through it all.  But once all this is &#8216;over&#8217; all the things I&#8217;ve got to do, like getting my independence back and going back to work etc. are things that I&#8217;VE got to do myself and noone can do them for me.  I know I&#8217;ll still have the love and support etc. but it&#8217;s me that&#8217;s got to get out there, get my confidence back and build my life back up again.  Anyway one step at a time.  I&#8217;m just a typical girl, thinking too much as usual!  These are all normal things to feel though according to the experts!  &amp; from books etc. that I&#8217;ve been reading, there are a lot of cancer survivors out there who have or or are feeling the same things.  I was reading a girl&#8217;s story earlier and she was saying how the doctors and nurses support you towards the goal of the day when they tell you that you don&#8217;t need to come back anymore. Obviously that&#8217;s a very important day but it doesn&#8217;t all end there for us, you don&#8217;t just get over it overnight.  I&#8217;m still left physically and emotionally scarred from all I&#8217;ve been through and have still got a lot of healing and recovering to do yet.  I&#8217;ve been feeling a really strange feeling of guilt since it was decided I&#8217;d be stopping after this chemo.  I can&#8217;t really put my finger on why.  Maybe because I feel I&#8217;m letting everyone down by stoppping?  Maybe letting myself down?  Giving up?  Strangely I feel guilt that I&#8217;ve got holidays and nice things planned when I feel like I should be in hospital being treated.  I don&#8217;t know why I feel that!  I&#8217;ve never in my life felt so many things that are so alien to me, it&#8217;s bizarre!  Anyway Prof assured me that I&#8217;m in no way giving up, I&#8217;ve in no way let ANYONE down and there&#8217;s no way I could have taken anymore treatment that I have.  The toxicity of the first 6 chemo was the most intense and most toxic that they will give and they couldn&#8217;t possibly have given me anymore.  So I think maybe I should stop giving myself a hard time and realise how well I&#8217;ve done, but I don&#8217;t feel like that yet.  Maybe it will come in time.  I&#8217;m always too hard on myself though in all things in life so why would I change now?!</p>
<p>Right I&#8217;m going to shut up now as this has probably been a bit heavy!  I don&#8217;t want you thinking I&#8217;m really struggling and really depressed because I&#8217;m not!  I&#8217;m still my cheerful self most of the time and if you saw me you probably wouldn&#8217;t sense any difference.  But it&#8217;s the people who REALLY know me who there&#8217;s no hiding what&#8217;s going on inside from.  I&#8217;m just confused and muddled at the moment but in this rollercoaster ride, I don&#8217;t dwell too much on how I&#8217;m feeling because it can change SO much from day to day so I&#8217;ll just take one step at a time and each day as it comes.  That&#8217;s all I can do.  I just think that the difficulty of the time after the treatment ends can be underestimated and I don&#8217;t want people to take the view of  &#8216;oh great it&#8217;s all finished, she&#8217;s ok now&#8217; &#8230;it&#8217;s really not as simple as that and anyone who thinks it is should count themselves VERY lucky to be in the fortunate position of being that innocently naive.</p>
<p>Oh just one quick story to share with you&#8230;today I met officially THE most stupid person I must&#8217;ve ever met!  I went down to the shop in the hospital&#8230;the specialist CANCER hospital.  I didn&#8217;t have my wig on and I was limping quite badly as my leg&#8217;s particularly painful today.  I was stocking up on a big pile of essential educational reading&#8230;Heat, OK, Closer&#8230;..very upmarked publications!  I went to the counter to pay</p>
<p>STUPID CHECKOUT GIRL: &#8220;What have you done?&#8221;</p>
<p>BALD, LIMPING CANCER PATIENT (ME!): &#8220;Sorry?&#8221;</p>
<p>STUPID CHECKOUT GIRL: &#8220;What have you done? You&#8217;re limping&#8221; (as if I didn&#8217;t KNOW I was limping!)</p>
<p>ME: &#8220;Yeah I am&#8221;  (hoping she&#8217;d sense me not wanting to talk about it!)</p>
<p>STUPID CHECKOUT GIRL: &#8220;So, what have you done then?&#8221; (she&#8217;s clearly not going to give up or get the hint!)</p>
<p>ME: &#8220;I haven&#8217;t DONE anything.  I&#8217;ve got cancer in my leg&#8221;</p>
<p>STUPID CHECKOUT GIRL: <em>Tone =  pure genuine shock </em>&#8220;OH!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8230;OH&#8230;MY&#8230;GOD&#8230;what on EARTH is between her ears because it&#8217;s certainly not a brain?!  Does she even know what building she&#8217;s working in?!  I don&#8217;t expect she know that oncology means cancer but it&#8217;s even called the Cancer &amp; Haemotology Centre.  She probably just thinks she&#8217;s working in a shopping centre and sometimes vaguely wonders why there&#8217;s lots of bald people, why the only other shop there is a wig shop and why there&#8217;s lots of wheelchairs and sometimes ambulances outside?!  Strange shopping centre!  The funny thing was though that she probably started to feel sorry for me when I told her, but actually I think I felt alot more sorry for her!  I mean, I can recover from cancer, but it&#8217;s not as if she can have a brain transplant!!!!  Classic!  If by any chance you&#8217;re reading this (on the off chance that you can actually read!) apologies for referring to you as &#8216;stupid checkout girl&#8217; but I didn&#8217;t catch your name as you were interogating me&#8230;</p>
<p>At least I can laugh about it!  Right then I promise to push off now!  Comment me or email me so I know someone&#8217;s reading!  Or I might stop writing!  Any publishers want to publish my story yet?!  Once again I won&#8217;t read this back, I&#8217;ll just hit the publish button.  I&#8217;ve never ever read back what I&#8217;ve written on here because I feel that if I did I would think twice about posting it and I&#8217;d start to edit&#8230;sometimes this might be a good thing, but the whole point of it is that it&#8217;s my chance to get out all my thoughts and feelings and to empty my head (I wish my head was half as empty as checkout girl&#8217;s!) so I hope you don&#8217;t mind reading my splurge of random thoughts!</p>
<p>Night night, don&#8217;t let the bed bugs bite!</p>
