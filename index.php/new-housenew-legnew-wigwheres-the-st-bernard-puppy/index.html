		<p>Hi all!</p>
<p>I’m very excited to be blogging, I wish I could’ve been doing it every day as I’ve actually felt like doing it but we don’t have the internet in our new house yet and unfortunately I spent last week back in hospital where the wireless connection was awful and everytime I got online it disconnected!  I’m now in Costa coffee using their free wireless so I can blog!  I had to get out of the house today…as lovely as it is I hadn’t been out of it since Sunday and I just needed to for my own sanity so Goose brought me into Fleet for a bit of retail therapy and coffee and internet usage!  I feel more sane now!  Although it’s not easy on crutches, if you think I can be clumsy ordinarily you should’ve seen me today, I must’ve knocked about 30 things over with my crutches in one shop, I was making a right show of myself!  Good job my wig didn’t fly off aswell!  Although it’s obviously convincing because in Dorothy Perkins she was trying to persuade me to sign up for a store card and the incentive was all these discounts in local salons…OBVIOUSLY that’s not going to persuade me at the moment!!</p>
<p>Anyway I’m getting distracted…so the update (brief version) is…</p>
<p>The last time I posted was when I’d just got out of the Nuffield Orthapedic Centre 2 and a half weeks after surgery and I’d had the good news from Prof about the response of the tumour to the chemo.  Thank you for everyone’s messages, cards, texts etc.  Each and every one of them means alot to me and I truly mean that.  I’ve been up and down since then…chemo started again on the Monday and unfortunately I was very sick from it again which was a shock after so long of not being sick.  It was shorter than it used to be and I was home by the Wednesday evening.  Except I couldn’t really go home as our lives were packed up into boxes and I don’t think I’d have managed the stairs etc. in our old tiny house very well!  So we went to my parents in the meantime which was fine but I did feel like a bit of a traveller just living out of a bag with my pj’s and wash bag and not knowing where I’d be sleeping from one night to the next…old house? new house? parent’s house?  or hospital?(most likely!)  Anyway so some predictably dodgy days in a post chemo haze (hey, that rhymes!!) and I struggled with the chemo effects alongside the surgery effects struggling to walk and make myself do my physio exercises when feeling so rough after chemo.  Going from my ‘break’ with no chemo and my leg feeling fine, to weeks of being bed bound after surgery and then being blasted with chemo again, it hit me pretty hard and I just wanted it to stop…but it can’t so that’s that!  Oh well!  (that’s mine and Anna’s motto!  If you say “Oh well!” after anything that seems bad,  it’ll seem ok!!  At least that’s the theory!)  Actually it started once when we’d had a curry and Anna said she was sooooo full she couldn’t posssibly eat anymore but then she looked at the curry left on her plate and said “Oh well!” and proceeded to shove more in her mouth and clear her plate!!  Haha sorry Anna, hope you don’t mind me sharing that story!</p>
<p>Anyway I digress again, sorry it’s because I haven’t been on her for so long, I’m babbling on!  So after a few days out of hospital we completed on our house on Friday 2nd October on Chris’s birthday…YAY!  I was very excited and wanted Chris’s birthday to be special too but I was still feel awful and shattered from the chemo but tried to keep my spirits up regardless.  Until…Friday morning after giving Chris his presents I felt I needed a nap before trying to face even getting up to attempt going to the house (even though I’d have been useless on my crutches and sitting down to avoid collapsing every 2 minutes!  Anyway so I rolled over to snooze and noticed blood on the duvet and then my arm…my Picc Line which I had put back in on the Monday (that’s ANOTHER story!) had been bleeding.  I HATE the site of blood and it totally panicked me!  Anyway to cut a long story short, we eventually sorted out a way of going into Frimley Park Hospital to get it checked without having to go through A&#038;E (the last thing I needed was to sit in there for hours, the worst place to be when trying to avoid infections!)  So we sorted it out via our contacts with my Prof at Frimley (who’d have thought I’d have 2 Profs at the age of 27!)  It meant I spent most of the day there with Goose waiting to be checked and then waiting for a full blood count check to ensure I was ok before I was released at about 7pm!  Phew!  I was so worried I’d be kept in…but they were concerned about me and wanted to check me again on Monday to make sure I was ok.  So I got the weekend at home in our new house but was still not feeling too good to say the least.  I somehow managed to make it out for a meal on Saturday evening for Chris’s birthday with 15 of our friends.  I wasn’t feeling too good but I wanted to make the effort for Chris’s birthday and I managed better than I thought I would once I was out.  Anna &#038; Dan kindly drove us and left with me after the meal so Chris could go out and celebrate!  Laura came with us too and we snuck back to Anna &#038; Dan’s and watched X Factor on Sky Plus!  Chris went out with the boys and let his hair down, so to speak…so much so that Dave had to walk him home (he said he’s never walked a bloke home before!  Yeah right Dave!!) and he then came in at 2.50 am and amongst other things that drunken fools do, he fell down the stairs and slept on the floor in the lounge!!  Buy a 5 bedroom house and sleep of the floor in the lounge on the 2nd night living there!!  Hilarious!  Well it wasn’t at the time, when I’m in bed unable to walk thinking he’s broken his neck or something until I hear an “I’m ok, I’m ok!!”  Bless him, he came upstairs to tell me he loves me approximately 300 times, with a response from me of “Yes I love you too, goodnight, let’s go to sleep now!”  I think it’s good for him to release it all from time to time and what better time than his birthday!  He’s been so amazing and continued to work so hard whilst supporting and caring for me unconditionally over the past 6 months, I couldn’t possibly ask for more.  Some girlfriends I’m sure would be mad for the drunken incident but I can laugh about it, it’s hardly crime of the century and life’s too short to be in a mood with someone you love!  Get over it!</p>
<p>Anyway I’ve completely lost the point of this…again!  After that weekend that was mostly spent in bed, I don’t think I entered any other rooms in our amazing house! (I’ll post some photos when I can!)  On the Monday I had to go to Oxford to see the surgeon and the physio…all was good there, happy with progress, slow but steady, scar healing well.  In fact the surgeon was so excited, he made me peel the dressing off and he was going “Oooh it’s like opening a Christmas present!”  I wouldn’t like to spend Christmas at his house if there’s a pile of limbs with wounds to unwrap under the Christmas tree!  Then he examined the wound and was like “ooooh doesn’t it look lovely!!”  Erm, NO!  It’s a great big cut down my leg, lovely isn’t the word that springs to my mind!!  He’s been great though and that’s obviously just how the mind of a surgeon works!  I can’t understand it myself but I’m glad he loves it so much as he’s got the evil cancer out of my leg!  Anyway after the checks in Oxford I had to go back to Frimley for a check of my blood count again.  Whilst waiting in the waiting room in my wheelchair as it was too far to walk on my crutches I suddenly got really hot and dizzy and ended up passing out!  Oops!  Not the right thing to do when trying to convince them I’m ok to go home and don’t need to stay in!  They did a blood check and it turned out I was anaemic again and neutropenic.  I needed a 3 unit blood transfusion (not unusual for me!) and platelets transfusion and IV antibiotics to be safe.  Great, I thought, back to square one. Just the same as before.  I was so disappointed but had had a feeling it would happen in the run up to it.  I knew in my heart I wouldn’t be going home that night (hence the bag packed in the car!)  So that was that.  With no rooms available in the private ward, I was put into the haematology isolation ward.  A modern, clean separate room but I felt it had the feel of a mental asylum!  &#038; if that was my first impressions…how would I feel after days of not leaving it!!…well I was there until Friday and it wasn’t much fun at all.  I was so disappointed after being told it was so much less likely to happen on this chemo and yet it happened exactly the same again.  Not to the extent of intensive care or as bad as some of the times before but still bad enough.  Even when I don’t feel that bad it’s the fact that every time it happens my life is at risk.  &#038; my Frimley Prof told me that in black and white on Friday.  It can’t keep happening because it’s risking my life and they don’t want to lose me at this stage in the treatment after such success so far.  It’s such a balancing act to pump enough poison into me to kill the cancer but not too much to kill me.  That’s what I think a lot of people don’t understand.  Because I try to be positive when I see and speak to people and so do my family and friends and Chris, people think it’s all ok.  I’ve struggled with that recently, it seems the longer this goes on the more ‘normal’ it becomes for people and because they think I’m coping they seem to have changed their attitude and just think I’m ok and it’s nearly over.  Well I am ‘ok’ but what does being ok mean?!  Compared to before this when I had my life, I’m not ok at all!  Compared to the really awful times like intensive care and those first chemo sessions then yeah I’m great!  It’s all relative but what I think some people don’t seem to understand is that I never feel ‘good’, I feel crap every single day, whether physically, mentally or emotionally…or all 3!  With so much to contend with, I’d be insane if I was on top of the world!  &#038; just because we’ve had good news about the treatment, yeah it’s great, of course it is and I totally appreciate that and am pleased but I’m still going through it everyday and I’ve still got a long way to go with lots more chemo and hospital stays and learning to walk and use my leg again!  It’s not over until it’s over and I will fight it to the end and I will keep going and I will stay as positive as I can.  I sound like I think no-one understands and that’s not the case.  The people closest to me have been amazing and you know who you are.  &#038; so many people I don’t see much have been fantastic too.  It’s just some people I get the impression they don’t really know what I’m going through…and not just me but everyone around me.  I’m not going to start naming and shaming and I don’t even know exactly who I mean it’s just a feeling I get and Goose, Chris and Anna have said the same cos they know me best and they’re going through it with me.  They see the highs and the lows and the in betweens!  Especially Goose who spends every day with me and Chris every evening.  Anna texts or calls everyday and I love her for that, she’s a true Scamp just like me!</p>
<p>On Friday I have an appointment with Prof in Oxford so we’ll discuss my chemo plans then as I think something will have to change with me going neutropenic again when he thought it’d be much less likely.  Then it’s back in for chemo on Monday L Oh well!</p>
<p>Anyway I could go on and on and on and on!…but Costa’s trying to close and I’m just sitting here tapping away!  I’m sorry I promised this would be brief at the start but you should know with me that it never is!  I’ll try and write more soon if I can get to a coffee shop or if Sky pull their finger out and activate our Broadband soon!  IF not I’m back in for chemo on Monday so I’ll be online then…</p>
<p>Love to you all!  Thank you Jan (AKA Billy!) for being my number one faithful blogger!!  I hope you found a pink outfit, you should’ve asked me the pink queen, I could’ve sorted you one out!!</p>
