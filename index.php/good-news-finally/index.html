		<p>Well I won&#8217;t beat around the bush(!)&#8230;the good news is&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;I had the mri scan yesterday and was quickly visited by Prof who told me that the tumour seems to be responding to the chemo as it&#8217;s showing signs of necrosis which is what they were hoping to see&#8230;wahoooooooooooo!!  YAY!!  So that was FINALLY a bit of good news in the midst of all this rubbish.  So basically what that means for me is that they&#8217;ll carry on as planned &#8211; so 2 more chemos then a little break and then surgery, probably early September.   The dates will get sorted out soon.  Then the chemo after surgery depends on what they find when they remove it etc.</p>
<p>So, chemo  starts again today (number 5) which I&#8217;m obviously not looking forward to but am in quite a positive frame of mind at the moment anyway and obviously the news yesterday has helped with that too!  I also managed to have a lovely weekend.  I got home Friday early evening and had until Monday morning at home.  Not long at all but long enough to catch up with lots of people and eat lots and make the most of my time at home!  Sleeping in my own bed was amazing but I did have a freaky experience Friday night when I woke up in the middle of the night convinced that I was still in my hospital bed and wondering why there was an arm lying next to me in my bed!  In my half asleep state I honestly thought I was in my tiny hospital bed with just an arm lying next to me&#8230;horror film style!!  Of course I then eventually realised (after poking and prodding the arm to check that it was in face an arm!) that the arm was attached to Chris who was lying next to me none the wiser, fast asleep!  It freaked me out alot for those few minutes before I realised!  I&#8217;m still blonde!!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also had some sad news too though&#8230;the lady who I met in here and who helped me so much with her positive cheerful attitude last time when I shared a ward with her, has passed away <img src="../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":-(" class="wp-smiley" />  I&#8217;ve just found out this morning.  She was only 39 and such a lovely person.  Life just isn&#8217;t fair and cancer is so evil.</p>
<p>Well I hope you&#8217;re all still reading and haven&#8217;t given up on carayapp.com!  I keep getting people telling me they check everyday and they&#8217;re missing it!  Sorry!  I shall endeavour to write on here more&#8230;although I&#8217;m not sure how much I&#8217;ll have to tell you as I&#8217;m in for another week of&#8230;not much!  I&#8217;ll try my best though!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll leave you with a little pearl of wisdom from the front of a card Lou gave me which is genius!&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;&#8221;A spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down! But I prefer chocolate&#8221; by Molly, age 5.  I agree with Molly age 5!!! xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</p>
