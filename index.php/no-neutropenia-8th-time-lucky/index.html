		<p>I&#8217;ve now made it to Friday without going neutropenic!  It&#8217;s a miracle!  I went into Frimley Park Hospital on Monday for a blood check and as predicted I did have to stay in.  However, it was progress as I wasn&#8217;t neutropenic, I was just (I say just!) anaemic and needed a  unit blood transfusion and platelets.  So I stayed in and had that on Tuesday and was out by Wednesday lunchtime!  Today I&#8217;ve been back for another blood count check just in case but I haven&#8217;t heard anything so I&#8217;m assuming everything&#8217;s ok, otherwise I&#8217;d be whizzed back in and put on a drip and antibiotics faster than I could say &#8220;but&#8230;!&#8221;</p>
<p>So, this is what I wanted and means I can continue chemo on the reduced dose.  Mixed feelings are brewing however&#8230;I&#8217;d kind of got use to the idea of having to stop and although this scared me due to the prospects of the cancer coming back if I hadn&#8217;t completed the course, I&#8217;d started to get secretly excited about not having to go through the chemo anymore and the thought of being a step closer to getting my life back&#8230; However I have to focus on why I&#8217;m going through it and I&#8217;m not getting this far to stop too soon so I will continue on my &#8216;journey&#8217;&#8230;I have the option to stop at anytime now if it&#8217;s too much  for me but no matter how tempting it is I WILL NOT BE DEFEATED by this!  I&#8217;m telling myself that as much as I&#8217;m telling you!</p>
<p>Anyway I&#8217;ve managed to fit in lots of visits this week&#8230;mainly due to it being half-term and so I&#8217;ve seen lots of my teacher friends!  On Tuesday my friend Vicky came to see me.  We did teacher training together and were very close but now she&#8217;s living back in Jersey (on the rock as she calls it!) where she&#8217;s from so it&#8217;s been over 2 years since I&#8217;d seen her!  Unfortunately I was in hospital for her visit, but it was still lovely to catch up after so long.  Then on Wednesday I left hospital by 12 and had already managed to plan a visit from Katie and Allie who I use to work with at Frogmore.  So they came round to see my house and we went out for a lovely lunch and chatted and gossiped until we realised it was 6pm!  Oops!  On Thursday my friend J came to visit, who I also did teacher training with.  We lived together in Southampton after we qualified too.  She&#8217;s now living in Colchester so we don&#8217;t see each other as much as we&#8217;d like but she&#8217;s been brilliant at sending me things to make me smile since I&#8217;ve been ill and she&#8217;s been to visit quite a few times too.</p>
<p>S0 I&#8217;ve been a lucky girl this week with visits!  Today I had to go to hospital (yawn!) for blood tests and for physio (not so yawn!)  A young fit male stroking my leg&#8230;and my bum today&#8230;!  It&#8217;s part of the exercises!!  IT IS!!  The good news is I&#8217;m now allowed to walk without wearing the leg splint that I&#8217;ve had to strap onto me for the past 7 weeks.  It feels weird, weak and wobbly but it&#8217;s progress so I&#8217;m happy.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m in a funny mood today, a bit frustrated by the limitations I have on me&#8230;even when I&#8217;ve recovered from the worst effects of the chemo I&#8217;m still so dependant on other people to help me because of my leg.  The worst thing about being on crutches is not being able to carry anything!  &amp; that it hurts your hands&#8230;&amp; that they fall over everytime you try to prop them up&#8230;ok ok so there&#8217;s quite a few annoying things about being on crutches but I won&#8217;t go on!  I still remind myself constantly that I&#8217;m lucky to have my leg and lucky to be here.  Maybe I&#8217;m not so lucky having got cancer in the first place but I can&#8217;t dwell on that and must  focus on the positives&#8230;</p>
<p>My dinner&#8217;s ready now, prepared by Jamie Oliver AKA Chris Newton!   I&#8217;ll write again soon and I think I need to jazz this site up with some photos so I&#8217;ll do my best&#8230;</p>
<p>Ciao for now! xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</p>
